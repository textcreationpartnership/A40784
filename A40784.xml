            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Epistle Dedicatory to the Right Honourable and truly Religious Lady, the Lady <hi>CLINTON.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is not worth the Errand of an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle Dedicatory of an Evangelical Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, to tell the world of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and greatness of its desired Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor: Nor would such an impertinent gawd at the entrance, much awaken and incourage your Honour to the perusal of what follows in the Body of the Book.</p>
            <p>And if I should (as more genuine and congruous) tell your Ladiship, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by my Reader, of the Piety that shines in all the circumstances of your Relations and Converse, I must expect that your humble and self-denying reflections on your self (to which the most worthy are the most disposed) world distaste it, as too much bordering upon the too common flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of Epistles Dedicatory, which seldom regard what is true, but what is plausible. Yet if I am obliged to give some account
<pb facs="tcp:101491:3"/> why I Dedicate this my poor undertaking, on so great a Subject, to your Ladiship, I am content to give you and my Reader some satisfaction. I have by your Honours favour, and the Conduct of a greater Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence been many years acquainted in my Ministerial work and converse with you, and divers of your Noble Family, as well as your Houshold, and its circumstances; on whom I have reason to believe my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns for your Spiritual and Eternal Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare have not been wasted, but have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced or fostered what hath been becoming the Gospel of Christ. And I know not why that Husbandman should be blamed whose prudence disposes his best seed on that ground which his experience hath proved genuine and fruitful.</p>
            <p>And (if it need it) I am content to crave pardon for saying that beside your Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Personal Conversation, and that of your Noble Sister the Lady <hi>Eleanor Hollis,</hi> (whom nature and piety hath bound to so near a Converse, that you know not well how to live asunder) I cannot remember that I have heard in your Family to the meanest of your Servants one sinful word, but observed so blameless a deportment that to say (their profession added) there is a Church in your House, or rather that your
<pb facs="tcp:101491:3"/> Houshold are fit matter for a Church, would not be beyond measured truth. And this I have said as that which the consideration of, hath been often grateful to me, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to engage persons of your quality and character (as to serious profession) to the like care in the choice and manage of their Housholds, and not to excuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from endeavouring it as a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible. But <hi>Madam,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides what is said in the Title of the Book presented to your Ladiship, which is almost all that can be said to perswade its acceptance (if the management of so great a Subject were answerable) I can say little to commend it to you. The Gospel of <hi>Peace,</hi> and the Government of our <hi>own</hi> spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits meeting together, will certainly create so happy an experiment, as will little need, and be much above the accessions of what most men court and adore, because they know no better.</p>
            <p>Your Ladiship hath been many years in Christs School of instruction, which the Noble Families of <hi>Clare</hi> by Title, and <hi>Hollis</hi> by proper name (of which you are so prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal a member) have not disdained, but embraced equally with the most forward Professors of Christianity. This is not to be post-poned to the greatest of your bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
<pb facs="tcp:101491:4"/> in this world, of which no good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count can be given, but by so learning Christ as to embrace and live <hi>the truth as it is in Jesus.</hi> This carries with it the wisdom, the comfort and fortitude of a Christian in this life, and the well-grounded evidence of an interest in the consummate blessedness of that which is to come.</p>
            <p>If I also add, that you are not unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Christs School of affliction, it is but saying that Divine wisdom hath given you the more means and advantages of learning, and being wise to Salvation; and that mark which none of Gods legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Children are without; a fruit of Gods faithfulness and fatherly care, which his best Children can no more be without, than infirm bodies without dieting and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. Some silly people take that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be most happy, which is most easie for the present; and <hi>that</hi> the most accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished wherein their most corrupt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons meet with no check, and their sleep in the forgetfulness of God and their duty is most undisturbed. Others (no more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning than they) propose to themselves, that if they can but clamber <hi>any how</hi> to greatness, and make their nests on the mountains of this world; they dwell where those vapours and storms have nothing to
<pb facs="tcp:101491:4"/> do, nor can find any place, that so much molest the meaner sort, that herd in the vallies. But <hi>Madam,</hi> you know, and are willing to know and have it known, that those great appearances have no such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, and that a moderation of spirit under adversities, and a holy improvement of them, is an aim and attainment much more rational and secure. <hi>Blessed is the man whom thou chastnest, O Lord, and teachest out of thy Law; that thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, &amp;c.</hi> But I have almost forgotten that I am writing an Epistle of this nature, and seem to my self discoursing with your Ladiship after my wonted freedom. I shall add no more but my wishes, raised to sincere requests to the Father of Mercies, and the God o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We have a long time last past been agitated so much in the dust and darkness of contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and mutually reproaching and (one way or other) afflicting and grieving each other, that we have almost lost all notions and idea's of our selves, our neighbour and fellow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, but what these provocations, heats and

Where is rest, if not in the fountain and center of all? What truth in manifest contradiction of all good and goodness? What interest is there in crossing our great End, and being drowned in eternal perdition, for a pleasant dream, or a short and little grasp of earth and vanity?</p>
            <p>Is it not horrid beyond expression, to desire, and madness to expect that God himself should part with his honour to <hi>humour us?</hi> and vilifie his holy and infinite perfections by (not only permitting, but) maintaining and countenancing a company of worms in those disorders that bid defiance to his wisdom, truth, power over, and interest <hi>in</hi> his own creature; who by him was brought from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing into being, all whose powers, supports, and comforts, derive from his fulness and bounty, who without his continuate concourse and supplies could neither eat nor drink, nor move, nor love, nor hate, nor live?</p>
            <p>I could not forbear to start those secret va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, which are the inward works and secret strengths by which our great adversary holds his prey till a stronger than he makes men willing to be happy, by being <hi>delivered from those powers of darknes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:101491:7"/> into the Kingdom of the dear Son of God, who is the King of Righteousness, and Prince of Peace.</hi> And what is this Kingdom of the dear Son of God but what is described by this Gospel of Peace?</p>
            <p>Certainly the great <hi>all heal</hi> is to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from this Gospel: were its directions universally or generally well understood, and embraced, and lived, the <hi>new heavens and the new earth wherein dwelleth righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> a holy and a happy Church and State would be immediately present. Nations, Cities, Families, Souls, from the greatest Prince to the meanest peasant, would not only specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, but feelingly know what true peace means. I am not now pleading for parties or great portions of this world. There has been such scrambling and scuffling for these among Christians by profession, and under pretence too of answering to the obligations of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, that the Gospel it self is almost lost, or smother'd in the crowd; or which is as bad or worse, 'tis charged with being the great peace-breaker, and causer of all the mischiefs. Some men think themselves wise enough to be happy in their <hi>own</hi> methods in the Church it self, were not the Gospel such an intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. The Gospel that teaches so much self-denial, that makes Jesus Christ in the form
<pb facs="tcp:101491:8"/> of a servant to be so perfect a pattern, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for Ministers of the Gospel; that allows no compulsions but a Conscience well inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a spirit made willing by its Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and the sensible apprehensions of God, and the great after-reckoning to the Divine Majesty. The Gospel, that obliges obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Princes out of Conscience to God, whose Representatives they are, reverence to their Persons, prayers and praises to God for their prosperity; Honour to whom honour, fear to whom fear, tribute to whom tribute, as most equal and due; love benignity, affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness and peaceableness to, and with all men.</p>
            <p>I have therefore as a kind of Appendix to this Treatise of the <hi>Gospel of Peace,</hi> annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a short one <hi>of the Government of our own spirits,</hi> without which all speculations will come short of use and practice. I know not what may be the acceptance or success of either, I leave them to his blessing, to the service of whose glory I can say by the Grace of God, they are designed. Some persons per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may esteem the whole impertinent, and the stile canting, and void of that masculine sense which is peculiar to one sort of men; but so much above the principles and genius of dissenters from them, especially those of
<pb facs="tcp:101491:8"/> the lower form, that if they should chance to read or hear somewhat of theirs that looks that way, they will hardly believe their own eyes or ears. But let them judg of me, or such as I and these poor Papers, as they please, I shall own and bless God for any thing of theirs that is worthy. And if I may but be a means to serve in any degree the interest of Christ, and souls, I hope I have counted the Costs, and shall not repent my undertaking, except the many sinful infirmities that have attended its manage, by an unworthy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in the Ministry of the Gospel,</p>

                  <p>WE have in these words one part or piece of that Armour, with its use, which the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Christians, and with them all that engage in the Christian Spiritual Warfare, to put on. But that we may the better understand the sense and

                  <p>Verse 11. <hi>Put on the whole armour of God,</hi> is an<note place="margin">Verse 11.</note> advice which gives the true exposition of being <hi>str<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

It is not only to have▪ our dependance on the immediate Divine Grace and Assistance; but also in the due use of all that Spiritual Armature he hath provided for us, to fortify us to, and in our duty, against all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that threaten us in it, or allurements that tempt us to depart from it.</p>
                  <p>This Armour is called the <hi>power of his might,</hi> First, As it is a power of Gods creating and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and which he hath provided and bestowed on us as his Auxiliaries, his helps and assistances, for our encouragement and ability to do our duty, and our security in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> As this Armour put on, and in its due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise hath an energy and efficacy to its designed ends, above and beyond all humane or natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality, agreeable to a Divine and Supernatural Power. <hi>For tho we walk after the flesh, we do not</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly,</hi> As there is a Divine Power annexed to every piece of this Armour in its <hi>due</hi> use, it is <hi>mighty through God:</hi> 'tis animated by <hi>his</hi> Spirit. So the Gospel is said to be the <hi>power of God to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This Armour will not be found Armour of proof, if not <hi>animated</hi> by a power above it self, or him that wears it. Indeed God hath promised the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of his Divine Power, where 'tis diligently improved: but still its <hi>efficacy</hi> lies not in it self, or our improvements, but the Divine Power <hi>annexed</hi> to, and acting by it. The holy Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Grace was not, but God's Grace assisting, <hi>his</hi> was <hi>sufficient</hi> for him.</p>
                  <p>Thus much is not only expedient to be said, in the consideration of <hi>verse</hi> 10. but necessary; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it concerns, and affects the whole of that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature whereof our Text is a part; and puts upon it that countenance which is its chief beauty, strength and glory.</p>
                  <p>This Armour of God, which is the power of <hi>his</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9.</note> might, is <hi>compleat</hi> Armour; not only with respect to its <hi>efficacy,</hi> but also in regard of its <hi>parts:</hi> there is some or other piece of this Armour for <hi>every</hi> part; according to the Apostles Military allusion to the body of a Soldier, armed at all points for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and defence, Cap-a-pe: no part <hi>wanting,</hi> no part to be <hi>neglected,</hi> but taken to us, and put on: And indeed any one part unarmed, is sufficient to expose us to wounds and death. Therefore we are exhorted to put on the <hi>whole</hi> Armour of God: <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101491:15"/> not only all its parts, but so united and <hi>compacted,</hi> as may render it (tho of divers parts, yet) one whole and well compacted Armour, leaving no space so much as between the <hi>joynts</hi> of the Harness, for an Arrow, or a fiery Dart to <hi>enter.</hi> In <hi>this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>'s Armour was defective, and it cost him his <hi>life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here let me observe by the way, that tho there be Armour even for the <hi>feet</hi> in this Divine fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, yet there is not the least provision to fortify the <hi>back,</hi> which yet is common in <hi>bodily</hi> Armour.

                  </p>
                  <p>Having said what I judged meet of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans spiritual Armour in general; I shall now consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>particular</hi> piece in my Text, <hi>appropriated</hi> to the <hi>feet. Having your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace.</hi> The Christian life is in Scripture often represented by a <hi>walk,</hi> a <hi>journey:</hi> But as 'tis a spiritual <hi>warfare,</hi> its motions may well be rendred a spiritual <hi>March,</hi> under the Command and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our Lord Jesus, the Captain of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>In common motions and travels, the <hi>feet</hi> are exposed to many calamities and sufferings; more especially to wounds and bruises, by length of jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; stony, thorny, rugged and uneven ways. It was a <hi>special</hi> evidence of God's care and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence over <hi>Israel</hi> in their journyings in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,<note place="margin">Deut. 8. 4. Deut. 29. 5.</note> that their Shooes did not wax <hi>old</hi> on their feet,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101491:15"/> neither did their feet <hi>swell</hi> in all the forty years they continued there. Here the Lord eked out their short store, and made there Leather wear like Iron; corrected natural infirmity, and made their tender feet travel-proof: that it might appear that God sometimes will make <hi>his</hi> ways free from pain, or penury, to those who ingage in them in sincerity, and trust in him. But in our spiritual motions, he has great variety of methods to preserve us from snares and mischiefs. That Promise made, and more <hi>particularly</hi> applied to our Lord Jesus, reaches all his followers: <hi>For he shall give his Angels charge</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 91. 11.</note>
                     <hi>over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways; and in their hands shall they bear thee up, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.</hi> It is prophesied of the promised Seed of the Woman, That the Serpent (meaning the Devil) should <hi>bruise</hi> his <hi>heel;</hi> which doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,<note place="margin">Gen 3. 15.</note> that his progress in the way, and work of our redemption, should be attended with <hi>sore</hi> tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and sufferings. And it is not without some intimation, that his Disciples and followers in the way of their duty, should meet with the same <hi>hard</hi> measures from Satan and his instruments: the proof of which hath fill'd up the Volumes of all the Ages of Christianity.</p>
                  <p>These considerations might tempt such, whose hearts are engaged to enter into, and walk in the holy ways of the Lord, to <hi>hesitate</hi> at the <hi>prospect</hi> of these unpleasing encounters: at least to take their steps <hi>fearfully</hi> and <hi>staggeringly,</hi> without that holy <hi>holdness,</hi> resolution, uprightness, thorowness, and <hi>assured</hi> Countenance as becomes the Servants of the <hi>Lord,</hi> the followers of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and those who, in the obedience of <hi>Faith,</hi> press toward the <hi>mark,</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:101491:16"/> the prize <hi>of our high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But our Text furnishes us against <hi>all fears</hi> of what we may meet with in our Christian Course, with Armour for our <hi>feet,</hi> Armour of God's <hi>own</hi> hammering, and of Divine appointment for our security: which if we put <hi>on,</hi> all fears and griefs will <hi>fall off</hi> of themselves: and our temptations<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>The next thing we have to consider in the Text, is the Armour it self, wherewith the Feet ought to be shod: and that is, <hi>The preparation of the Gospel of peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Gospel of <hi>Peace</hi> is such Furniture, as is <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> to prepare us to, and fit us for our Christian wayfare▪ and warfare: No <hi>wise</hi> man will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take either of these▪ but he will first be <hi>prepared</hi> with what is meet to carry him thorow (if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) both safely and comfortably.</p>
                  <p>Such an accomplishment is the Gospel of Peace to those who are <hi>shod</hi> with it. They are <hi>aforehand</hi> with whatever may happen: have <hi>prevented</hi> all dangers or disapointments. And 'tis call'd a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> because till we are furnished with it, we are no way fit for the profession and <hi>life</hi> of Christianity: But when this is put on, we are ready prepared to duty, and all that attends it.</p>
                  <p>All that remains for the opening the Text is, to shew what this Gospel of Peace is, that is such a necessary and blessed preparation.</p>

                     <hi>I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</hi> And it agrees most exactly, and in the highest sense, with the true design and nature of the Gospel: For the Gospel contains, declares, and tenders the <hi>medicinal remedying</hi> Law and Covenant of Grace: The cure of that sin and misery deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the <hi>fall,</hi> the methods of Divine wisdom in the prosecuting the gracious end of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between God and sinful undone Man: than which, what can be more welcome to a rational creature, sensible of his misery, and desirous of a Recovery?</p>
                  <p>The old <hi>English Saxon</hi> expressed the <hi>Gospel</hi> by two words, <hi>viz. Gots-spel</hi> or <hi>Gods-spel:</hi> the Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine import of which, was Gods cure or remedy. But we are not to restrain the Sense of this term <hi>Gospel,</hi> to the mere <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the Covenant of Grace, in which Sinners become interested by <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> Evangelical and saving Faith: but to extend it to all its Precepts, Doctrines, Advices: yea, to its warnings and <hi>menaces,</hi> all which in the due use of them, have <hi>some</hi> share in this <hi>Preparation</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of Peace.</p>
                  <p>Three Doctrines or Propositions will take in the Sense of the Text: all which I purpose (if the Lord will) to consider, according to the interest they have in the Text, and the share they (seem to me to) contribute to our Edification in the Grace and <hi>Peace</hi> of the Gospel.</p>

Motion or Agitation (simply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered) is no Breach of our Peace: but Contrariety and Contradiction, this is <hi>War,</hi> the true <hi>Breach</hi> of the Peace, where we have not a <hi>Defence</hi> suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to secure us.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> had Adversaries and Adversities attended him whereever he came: but tho he could not <hi>fly</hi> them, he did <hi>escape</hi> them: <hi>None of these</hi>

                  <p>A Negative Peace alone, is a very bare and <hi>beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly</hi> thing. Not to be sick, in pain, any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted, afflicted, or unhappy: This is the peace of a Stock, or a Stone: <hi>not</hi> that of a sensible and rational being: of all created beings, the <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,</hi> as they are most <hi>capable,</hi> so they are most <hi>craving.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How unhappy a thing is it to <hi>hunger and thirst,</hi> and have nothing to answer and satisfie those <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement</hi> Appetites? Man is a <hi>large</hi> Vessel, if he be not fill'd with what is <hi>Connatural,</hi> agreeable to him, somewhat unfriendly, <hi>unkind</hi> and injurious, must fill up the Room. A Vessel not fill'd with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101491:18"/> more <hi>solid</hi> Matter, will entertain <hi>mere</hi> Air, rather than <hi>any</hi> Emptiness.</p>
                  <p>A mere negative peace is a <hi>dead</hi> peace. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> salutation, <hi>Peace be with you,</hi> intended <hi>all</hi> good things, whatever might contribute to their joys. Life and Peace <hi>morally</hi> considered, are but the <hi>same</hi> things: And the Apostle couples them as <hi>pares</hi> of like import. <hi>To be spiritually minded is life and</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 6.</note>
                     <hi>peace:</hi> They are exegetical or interpretative each of other. It is observable what is said of <hi>Nabal,</hi> in the direction of <hi>David</hi>'s Message to him. <hi>Say to him that liveth in prosperity,</hi> so <hi>our</hi> Translation: But in the original 'tis only, Say to him that <hi>liveth:</hi> for no man liveth that liveth not comfortably: and also no man has true solid peace, but he that injoys himself, by injoying what is necessary to his satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly,</hi> Peace is an aquiescence in the true matter or means of satisfaction which we possess, or may possess.</p>
                  <p>Heaven it self would not be sufficient to create a Peace for that man who cannot aquiesce in its fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. The fallen Angels, and our first Parents, had enough in those stations wherein God had placed them, to fill their capacity, to answer the <hi>utmost</hi> of their affections: and whilest they <hi>aquiesced</hi> therein, they had perfect peace. But when once their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires shot themselves beyond <hi>those</hi> bounds, their conditions grew <hi>uneasie,</hi> their Peace was broken.

                  <p>What is the cause that all men that hear the Gospel of Peace, are not immediately changed into its <hi>image:</hi> I mean their Souls blessed with its Peace? It must be either from their disbelief of the real <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence</hi> of those good things proposed there, or at least their suspicion that they are not attainable by them; or which is the most prevailing, that their hearts cannot, or do not aquiesce in, and embrace them as a <hi>sufficiency,</hi> an adequate good: And this is the true cause of the impossibility of the peace of that man, whose Principles, or Affections, and Will, are under the prevalency of corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>

And that <hi>likeness</hi> of God, which is a congruity of the glorified creature to all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perfections, renders it capable of satisfaction in that God, between whom and such a Soul there is so exact and compleat an <hi>agreement.</hi>

                     <hi>2dly,</hi> The <hi>tendency</hi> of the Gospel to Peace.</p>
                  <p>There is the highest and most <hi>accomplished</hi> ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to Peace in the Gospel: The means answers the <hi>end,</hi> suitable to that good will and wisdom that is <hi>peculiar</hi> to the Divine Being. No natural cause hath a more exact tendency to its proper effects. All its Promises, Provisions, Precepts, Cautions, Convictions, Instructions: yea, its very Chidings, Menaces, and <hi>Chastisements,</hi> conspire to carry on this blessed end of <hi>peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly,</hi> Its Proposals, and Tenders, and Treaties, are Peace.</p>
                  <p>Peace is the Pearl it offers: The great business its Ministers and Ambassadors are to treat of: And they are unworthy of the <hi>name</hi> of Ministers of the Gospel, who so far forget its errand and their <hi>own,</hi> as to neglect the blessed work of <hi>Peace-makers:</hi> But of all others, they who contradict it <hi>so far,</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of tendering and treating <hi>God</hi>'s Peace, vent their own <hi>Passions</hi> to serve their own Parties, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and Carnal Interests.</p>
                  <p>The hypocritical <hi>Jews mocked</hi> God, and abused his Ordinance of <hi>fasting,</hi> by fasting for strife and debate: and were severely reproved for their pains,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101491:20"/> by him they pretended to worship, serve, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile. <hi>Behold, ye fast for</hi> strife and debate, <hi>to smite with the fist of</hi> wickedness: <hi>Ye shall</hi> not <hi>fast as ye do</hi> this day. <hi>Is not this the fast that I have chosen:</hi>

                     <hi>4thly,</hi> The Gospel <hi>Commands</hi> and wooes Peace, and directs us into the <hi>way</hi> of it. The Lord doth not by his Gospel commend it to us, and leave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>The Gospel passes from Commands to Intreaties. <hi>Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, as tho' God did beseech you by us. We pray you in Christs stead be ye reconciled to God.</hi> If our hearts be inclined to Peace, but we are ignorant of the way of it, the Gospel becomes our director, <hi>To guide our feet into the way of peace.</hi>

                  <p>They are actually so with some or other, as froward and perverse as the World is to Peace, to whom the Gospel of Peace makes its addresses. None of God's designs are barren and vain. And if his Will and Design be to promote Peace by the Gospel, and especially Peace with God: it shall have these effects somewhere: God has told us <hi>afore-hand</hi> it shall be so, tho' he has not told us the persons by <hi>name.

                     <hi>make his soul an offering for sin, He shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.</hi> We may take that Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of Christ, for the <hi>Exposition</hi> of this concerning<note place="margin">Joh. 12. 32. Isa. 55. 10, 11.</note> him: <hi>And I, when I am lift up will draw all men to me:</hi> i. e. by <hi>reconciliation,</hi> by my Gospel of Peace. What can we think of those promises of writing God's Law in the <hi>mind?</hi> giving a heart of <hi>flesh?</hi> The sense of which is, their being <hi>reconciled</hi> to God; but that some, and many shall be wrought on, savingly to perform the terms of life in the Covenant of Grace. No one person, or sort of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101491:21"/> persons, however qualified, can be here pointed out, but are all hid in the <hi>Arcana</hi> of God's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; 'tis effectual calling must speak them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to belong to the election of Grace.</p>
                  <p>This certain infallible <hi>efficacy</hi> that was certain and <hi>future,</hi> before it had any actual being, methinks is hard to be reconciled to that opinion, that leaves all reconciling saving successes of the Gospel of Peace, to <hi>uncertain Contingencies;</hi> which is to say, it might, or was most likely to be savingly effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual: But it was possible it might so come to pass, that not one Soul might be reconciled by it. It was so left to the Liberty and Power of Man, that he had the turning of the Scale.</p>
                  <p>The last Consideration I offer, upon which it is, or may very <hi>congruously</hi> be called the Gospel of Peace, is, That it is the only <hi>revealed</hi> way of Peace.</p>
                  <p>I am neither so adventurous or <hi>uncharitable,</hi> as to utter any Sentence against the more <hi>honest</hi> Heathen, who lived up to their light, which God hath <hi>not</hi> denounced in the Patent writings of his Word.

                  <p>It hath not any design for the Peace of the <hi>Holy</hi> Angels, who have kept their <hi>first</hi> habitation.</p>
                  <p>The God of Peace hath found them always where, and what they ought to be: In that order and decorum wherein he first placed them. They never sinned, and therefore never brake their <hi>Peace</hi> with God, nor among themselves: And therefore need no Gospel, nor other means to <hi>reconcile</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture tells us, that they desire to <hi>look</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet▪ 1. 12.</note> into the things contained in the Gospel: But this <hi>desire</hi> is, to behold the glory of the Divine attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes shining forth in Grace, riches of Grace to sinners among men: Such Grace as hath an height, and depth in it; beyond the prospect and reach of Angels, without the help of Divine Revelation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> It is not a Gospel of Peace that hath any design to reconcile the Devils, or <hi>faln</hi> Angels: These <hi>are reserved in everlasting Chains, under darkness,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It hath been put as a question, Why God should shew so much Grace and Favour to faln Man, and none at all to the faln Angels? Why the Son of God <hi>took on him, not the nature of Angels, but the seed of</hi> Abraham? Seeing they were creatures who, by <hi>nature</hi> were so much <hi>superiour</hi> to man in all excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies; in substance <hi>spirits,</hi> but Man a poor lump of <hi>clay,</hi> quickened by a <hi>Soul,</hi> but one step above the <hi>brutes:</hi> In strength so much superiour, as a Man is to a Worm, and more: In knowledg and sagacity, as admits not the wisest of men to any <hi>comparison:</hi> In duration <hi>immortal,</hi> whereas man begins to dye as soon as he begins to live: In their habitation, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in the Heaven of Heavens, Courtiers and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate attendants on the Holy and Divine Majesty; whereas man hath his foundation in the <hi>dust,</hi> dwells in a habitation of <hi>clay,</hi> is a poor creeping worm on God's <hi>foot-stool.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is commonly answered, that God dealt <hi>more</hi> severely with them than with man, because their sin was of a <hi>deeper</hi> stain, more exceeding sinful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1st.</hi> As they were placed in an higher station, and their fall was accordingly greater.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> They had greater <hi>ability</hi> to stand, whereas man had but a <hi>bare</hi> sufficiency.</p>

                     <hi>3dly,</hi> They had more immediate knowledg of God; and a more compleat and intimate injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him.</p>

                  <p>That man who dare affront the Will of God with the Law of his own reasonings, and oppose plain Scripture words and sense with his rules of equity; Let him consider this Divine practical Comment on those words, <hi>I will have mercy on whom</hi>

                  <p>The great Doctrine of the Gospel is, <hi>Peace with God through Jesus Christ: preaching peace by Jesus</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Conscience, yea, <hi>natural</hi> Conscience can discern and reflect on the wound, the breach made by sin betwixt a sinner and his God: Tho of it <hi>self,</hi> it can neither work, nor <hi>discern</hi> the cure.</p>
                  <p>Our first Parents fled from the presence of God<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 8, 10, 11.</note> at the fright which <hi>Conscience</hi> raised in their Souls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I was afraid, because I was naked.</hi> They knew they were naked, exposed to <hi>God</hi>'s displeasure and their <hi>own</hi> shame. But, <hi>Who told thee that thou wert naked?</hi> No other but his <hi>own</hi> Conscience told him so; And the same Conscience that told him he was
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101491:25"/> naked, remembred him of the <hi>Law</hi> he had trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed, the <hi>penalty</hi> of death incurred thereby, the <hi>loss</hi> of Divine favour, his being exposed to intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable and inevitable <hi>vengeance.</hi> The same Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence made such application of these direful consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, that as he fled from the presence of the offended God, so he would gladly have fled from himself and from his Conscience also, that bound him; his sin, and his punishment together: From his Conscience that was become his Enemy; and fought against him in God's stead, and with God's Weapons.</p>
                  <p>Thus it was between <hi>Cain</hi> and his Conscience.<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 13, 14.</note> When God had passed his sentence on him for his fratricide, his Conscience makes the poyson and smart of it stick to his bones; <hi>My punishment is greater than I can bear.</hi> He turns Vagabond, but could not flee from his Conscience. His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science frights him with the terrors of death, to be executed by the next hand that meets him. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever meets me shall slay me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An accusing and condemning Conscience, is sin open before hand, and haleing the Soul to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: An antidated Hell. It lies at the <hi>door,</hi> at the catch to <hi>Arrest</hi> the guilty Soul. O what would not a man give for Peace with Conscience, who hath felt its stings, and carried its Hell in his bosom wherever he goes, wherever he is, in his down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying, his up-rising, his worship, his reading, his meditations, his table, his cups, yea in his very dreams?</p>
                  <p>This blessed Gospel is a Gospel of Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a sinner and his terrible <hi>intimate</hi> enemy, an <hi>awakened</hi> Conscience. And this naturally follows
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101491:25"/> peace with God. Where peace with God is by the word and Spirit of God proclaimed in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners soul, with <hi>convincing</hi> evidence: Conscience, which is Gods instrument, lays down its weapons, becomes our friend, and treats us as the friends and confederates of God.</p>
                  <p>When God speaks peace by his Gospel, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science eccho's to its voice, and says so too.</p>
                  <p>This is the <hi>answer of a good Conscience</hi> to Gods<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 21.</note> voice and our inquiries. That man who embraces the Gospel of peace, that <hi>Gospel</hi> will <hi>instruct</hi> his Conscience to speak peaceably and kindly to him.</p>
                  <p>The sprinkling of the Blood of Jesus which the Gospel discovers and applies, will be the sinners <hi>Passover.</hi> Where <hi>that</hi> is found on the <hi>Door-posts,</hi> Conscience has no power to smite with death.</p>
                  <p>The believing converted sinner, will be no more frighted from the presence of the Lord: But, can <hi>draw nigh to him</hi> (as the best of his Paradise) <hi>with a true heart, in full assurance of faith; having his heart sprinkled from an evil conscience, and his body washed with pure water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And though it so falls out with some really Evangelized souls, that by the sentence of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel they have peace with God, yet by the sentence of Conscience 'tis directly <hi>contrary.</hi> This does not arise from any <hi>defect</hi> in the Gospel, but of our own <hi>misunderstanding the Gospel,</hi> or our own <hi>hearts.</hi> And Conscience being an <hi>human faculty,</hi> can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect no further than enlightened by the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: yea it goes along with <hi>that,</hi> tho into a gross error.</p>
                  <p>But that Spirit of God which is the Spirit of the Gospel, does ordinarily, and will (when
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101491:26"/>
'tis congruous to divine wisdom) cause our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to joyn issue with <hi>his</hi> evidence of peace, where<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 14, 15, 16.</note> we are <hi>truly</hi> reconciled to God. <hi>For, as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the spirit of Adoption, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we cry Abba Father. The Spirit it self beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with our spirit, that we are the Children of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might add, that the Gospel assists to peace of Conscience, as it directs and moves to that frame of heart and life, as preserves our peace with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. For besides our peace with Conscience as to our state for eternity, and general reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God, we are concern'd to preserve it with respect to particular actions, and the whole frame of our life. Tho Conscience enlightned will not charge a man as a damned sinner for every careless, or wilful failing, and throw hell in his face; yet, it will charge him as a sinner, and it may be as guilty of deeply aggravated sin; such sin as God will not only hide his face for, but frown, threaten, and execute severe displeasure. Now he that according to the Rules of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,<note place="margin">Acts. 24. 16.</note>
                     <hi>sincerely</hi> exercises <hi>himself to have a conscience void of offence towards God, and towards men,</hi> shall maintain such a peace with conscience that he shall not be so much as accused, threatned, or chid by it; yea, it will be an excusing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, and justifying Conscience. <hi>For our rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12.</note>
                     <hi>is this, the testimony of our conscience, &amp;c. that in simplicity and godly sincerity—we have had our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation in the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>A stated inward peace universally consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered:</hi> It is such a peace the Gospel derives to us
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101491:26"/> when sincerely embraced, as makes all calm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>exclusive</hi> of perturbation from any cause, or consideration whatsoever. There are other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows that sometimes stick in the soul, besides those that flie from the quiver of an irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled God, or an awakened, troubled, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting Conscience. As losses and crosses in the world, fears of foes, desolations, wants of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary relief, frowns of men, and others innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Such as these (without the former) may pave all our paths with thorns and briers; stuff our pillows with anxious and perplexing thoughts and cares.</p>
                  <p>But the Gospel of Peace embraced, and applied in its directions, promises and comforts, will maintain an inward peace and tranquility against all their assaults. <hi>I will lay me down in peace and</hi>

                  <p>And well may he be at peace who has God for his stay against all storms; and as such, he is no where represented but in the Gospel-promise; that promise is a branch of the Gospel-Covenant, <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed</hi>

But suppose the mind be feeble, and wavering in this act of reliance; here is that which makes sure work for our peace, who trust in him, tho so defectively.

                  </p>
                  <p>They have all the <hi>same</hi> heaven, the place of everlasting rest, which is the journeys end they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101491:28"/>
                     <hi>aim</hi> at, and shall obtain. 'Tis for this self-same <hi>Rest</hi> they are now all <hi>preparing,</hi> and are dispositively prepared by the spirit of grace that abides, and lives in them. <hi>For he that hath wrought us for the self-same thing is God, who hath also given unto us of</hi>

                     <hi>his Spirit.</hi> And as they have but one heaven, their journeys end; so they have but one way, the <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of faith;</hi> tho with respect of different stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, conditions, circumstances, <hi>understandings</hi> also, they may not tread <hi>just</hi> in the same <hi>track.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Lord Jesus in his blessed Gospel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and commends peace to his followers with the greatest <hi>authority</hi> and most Pathetical expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He leaves them <hi>peace</hi> as a legacy, and leaves as his last and dying command (when his love wrought <hi>highest,</hi> and his sufferings for them were within a few hours of their hottest) that they would do that in remembrance of him which is the Symbol of the most principal union and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of love and peace one with another: I mean the holy Sacrament of the Lords-Supper. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises the presence of the God of <hi>love and peace</hi> with them that live in peace; and threatens a <hi>severe</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon the breakers of the peace, that smite<note place="margin">Mat. 24. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>9.</note> their fellow servants.</p>
                  <p>The Laws which the Gospel lays on us of love, forbearance, bearing one anothers burdens; pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and supporting one anothers infirmities; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all we can, and covering what we cannot cure, does certainly render it a Gospel of peace for good men, one among and towards another. It teaches them to be so far above indifferent things, childish <hi>toyes,</hi> as to believe them below their conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but if such fancies <hi>do</hi> possess any, then to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101491:28"/> one another in love, and not deal judgings, and severe censures on the one hand, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts on the other, which the eminent and holy <hi>Austin</hi> elegantly resolves into these few words, <hi>In necessariis unitas, in nonnecessariis libertas, in omnibus charitas.</hi> In necessary things unity, in unnecessary things liberty, in all charity.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the Gospel represents Christians so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by grace, that if it be diligently improved and exerted, all that court and <hi>complement,</hi> that benign, obliging deportment, that civilizes and reconciles the world by art, will be found in Christians, as the genuine products of renewed nature. To conclude, these are the Gospel repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations of Christian engagements and disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to peace among <hi>themselves,</hi> which if they were all drawn to the life upon its professors, the whole Christian world would be the <hi>terra pacata,</hi> Zion would be a peaceable habitation. All its <hi>live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> stones would quietly lie in their order, in this Temple of God on <hi>earth.</hi> They would no more <hi>disturb</hi> each others peace, nor justle into anothers place. All would be one sweet <hi>Consort,</hi> contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the beauty, strength, and comfort of the whole building.</p>
                  <p>Consider what is spoken of those days, wherein the Gospel of peace shall prevail at another rate than now, and impress its image with more <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 55. 11. 12, 13.</note> on the Church. <hi>So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth, it shall not return unto me void.—it shall prosper whereto I sent it.</hi> And what doth this efficacy of the Gospel particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend? <hi>For you shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace.—Instead of the thorn shall come up the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101491:29"/> fir-tree, and instead of the bryer shall come up the myrtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree.</hi> The same word we now are so <hi>poorly</hi> affected with, shall one day bring forth a richer crop of<note place="margin">Aut hoc non est E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, aut nos non sumus Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lici.</note> grace and peace. The ancient reproof confirms the truth I am affirming, <hi>Either this is not the Gospel, or we are no Christians.</hi> It was a degenerating age, tho (perhaps) not half so much as ours.</p>
                  <p>Whatever men may pretend unto, for bearing the name of Christianity, they may measure their distance from the thing it <hi>self,</hi> or their approaches to it, much, by the <hi>peaceableness</hi> of their spirits, and deportment towards their brethren. Their souls who dwell far from dispositions to peace, have no <hi>intimacy</hi> with the Gospel. Let them who make earnings for their pleasure, or their profit, by smiting their fellow-servants, consider the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of <hi>Mat. 24. ver.</hi> 49. to the end of the <hi>Chapt. But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My Lord delayeth his coming, and shall begin to smite his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken. The Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not ware of; and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites. There shall be weeping, and gnashing of teeth.</hi> So far as this Text concerns <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi> whom certainly it concerns as deeply as <hi>any;</hi> it aggravates their <hi>cruelty</hi> to their fellow-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, by its being joyned with their own sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and luxury. And I need not use many words to perswade the present age, that those who have dealt such severe blows to good men, have ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily been very complaisant and fellowly with the worst, if not partaking with them in their follies.</p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:101491:29"/>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The Gospel contributes very much to our peace with bad men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. By prescribing, and disposing good men to a peaceable affection and carriage towards the <hi>bad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Gospel is no such narrow <hi>strait-laced</hi> thing, as to restrain a kind, benign, and courteous car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to the <hi>best,</hi> or <hi>better</hi> sort of men. Bad men, yea notorious <hi>hypocrites,</hi> who are the <hi>sink</hi> of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature, are by <hi>its rules</hi> and principles, to partake of our civilities and charity. <hi>Do good to all men, but especially to them who are of the houshold of faith.</hi> Those who are best deserving, are to have the greatest share in our complacence and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; yet the worst of men not to be wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned, but their shreds of goodness to be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,</hi> and their necessities supplied from a sincere benevolence.</p>
                  <p>It obliges us to follow peace with <hi>all men,</hi> so far as not to part with holiness. Not only to accept peace when it <hi>offers</hi> it self, admit it when it <hi>courts</hi> us, but to pursue it when it <hi>flees</hi> from us. We must not part with peace with any man if it may be had, and preserved upon tollerable terms. This<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 14</note> peaceable and benign spirit to evil men, the Gospel teaches us to be the <hi>image</hi> of God, that wherein consists a <hi>principal</hi> part of Godliness or God-like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>That ye may be the Children of your Father which is in heaven; for he maketh his Sun to rise on the evil, and the good; and his rain to fall on the just and the unjust.</hi> These are the Gospel-lessons, which few of the Heathen understood; and the morose narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted <hi>Jews</hi> expunged with their <hi>false</hi> Glosses.</p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:101491:30"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly,</hi> A compliance with the Gospel-directory, mightily conduces to procure and conciliate <hi>peace</hi> from evil men, to those who are good and holy.</p>
                  <p>Were the Lessons and Principles of the Gospel more <hi>lively</hi> represented by the conversations of its <hi>professors,</hi> it would in a great degree abate the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and <hi>injuries</hi> of the worst of men. Tho they have no principles of Grace, it would work on the remains of <hi>good nature. These men</hi> (said the <hi>Amorites</hi> of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Family) <hi>are peaceable with us: therefore let</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 34. 21</note>
                     <hi>them dwell in the land, and trade with us.</hi> And let it be supposed that the bad natures of unregenerate men has a <hi>radicated</hi> enmity to the godly as such; yet not only <hi>humane</hi> alliance, but common <hi>interests</hi> would engage to peace with such men who bear the image of the Gospel. <hi>Who will harm you, if ye</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 13.</note>
                     <hi>be followers of that which is good?</hi> None certainly that have any sparks of goodness <hi>remaining</hi> in them. None that have any regard to justice or <hi>modesty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Gospel contributes to peace with ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> Men may be bad men, and yet in no <hi>actual</hi> enmity with the good and holy. But suppose there be such as hate thee personally; yea, that are in professed enmity to all that bear the name of <hi>seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> professors of Christianity; A Gospel-conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may do much, not only to <hi>allay</hi> or quench the flames of enmity and injuries, but also to turn them into friendship and kindness. The Gospel of peace hath a Medicinal vertue, to heal and make peace here.</p>
                  <p>It may be this just, amicable, peaceable deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under all provocations, may <hi>melt</hi> them down into a better temper. The cords of a man are<note place="margin">Prov. 16. 7.</note> cords of love. <hi>When a mans ways please the Lord, it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101491:30"/> shall make his enemies to be at peace with him.</hi> This is a Lesson not only of the Divine Wisdom, who knows the ways of mans heart, and all its secret wards, but 'tis also a lesson of <hi>experience: Saul</hi> was a bitter enemy to <hi>good David,</hi> but when he had an evident proof of <hi>Davids</hi> fidelity, his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, a spirit free from base <hi>revenge:</hi> How did it <hi>take</hi> with him? What a flood of Pathetical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of a heart moved with the undeserved kindness of this good man <hi>David,</hi> did it wring out of him? <hi>Is this thy voice, my Son David! And</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 24. 16.</note>
                     <hi>Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.—If a man find</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 26. 21.</note>
                     <hi>his enemy, will he let him go well away? Thou hast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil. I have sinned. Return, I will do thee no more harm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the Gospel of Peace (in the life and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it) do sometime <hi>reconcile</hi> an enemy, change his <hi>heart;</hi> how much more may it chain up his <hi>hands,</hi> or make him let <hi>fall</hi> his weapons of offence;<note place="margin">Matt 5. 43, 44.</note> especially, if we arrive to those more noble heights<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 34.</note> of Evangelical generosity, as to <hi>love</hi> our enemies, <hi>bless</hi> them that <hi>curse</hi> us, <hi>pray</hi> for them that <hi>perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 7. 60.</note> us, and <hi>despitefully</hi> use us; and let these be all the revenges we do, or <hi>aim</hi> at, to take of them. Methinks that petition (with the measure it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses) in the Lords-Prayer, is of an high strain; <hi>Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass against us.</hi> The sense of which is, If we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give not our <hi>injurers,</hi> do not thou forgive <hi>us.</hi> Deal by us as <hi>we</hi> deal by them. If we wish <hi>evil</hi> to them that hate and abuse us, let our prayers be turn'd into the greatest <hi>curse</hi> that can fall upon our <hi>selves.</hi> If this be not our <hi>meaning</hi> when we utter this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101491:31"/> to God, we are most <hi>gross</hi> hypocrites, or such <hi>ignorant</hi> Sots that we understand not our prayers in a most plain, <hi>easie</hi> instance. If this be our meaning, our practice will certainly in some good degree <hi>conform</hi> to it. And where 'tis so, it will be no mean inducement to the most <hi>barbarous</hi> to be at <hi>peace</hi> with us.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>An account of the nature of that Peace which is the design and tendency of the Gospel of Christ.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHat I shall say on this head, will chiefly refer to that peace which is between <hi>God and a reconciled sinner;</hi> tho in some things it may extend to <hi>other</hi> parties <hi>in,</hi> and considerations <hi>of</hi> this peace.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>It is a Divine peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. A peace of which God <hi>alone</hi> is the author and contriver as to all the articles of it. All its ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles that concern the Promises on Gods part, the terms and conditions of enjoying them on mans part, are all of Gods <hi>sole</hi> authority and disposing. No man on earth, nor Angel in Heaven, had any thing to do in their <hi>composure.</hi> God did never <hi>treat</hi> with any man to agree about the terms of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, nor to propose what he would be content to submit unto, for <hi>reconciliation</hi> with his God.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:101491:31"/>
               <p>As the Law of <hi>Commandments</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> so the Law of <hi>Grace,</hi> and Covenant of Promise from Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> was so compleated by God <hi>alone,</hi> that no room was, or shall ever be left for man to set the least hand to it. No room left for any <hi>alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> any <hi>new</hi> condition. God hath made a large abatement, and relaxation of the Law of Works, as a Condition and Covenant of Life; but of this Covenant of Grace, the Law and terms of life contained in <hi>that,</hi> he will bate nothing to the best, or greatest of men.</p>
               <p>He that will have peace with God, must have it on Gods <hi>own terms,</hi> these <hi>Gospel</hi>-terms, or go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, and shift for himself as well as he can. It is therefore call'd altogether <hi>Gods Covenant</hi> in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, because tho man be one of the <hi>foederati,</hi> yet he is so only by <hi>accepting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This peace as to the Covenant on which 'tis founded, is called a Covenant of <hi>promise,</hi> to denote that, 'tis not terms of <hi>justice</hi> or equity on <hi>our</hi> part<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 12.</note> that hath any concern in it, any <hi>plea</hi> to make, 'tis all as freely and fully Gods, as gift it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> It is a Divine peace, as to the <hi>accepting</hi> it, closing with the <hi>terms</hi> of it on <hi>our</hi> part. I am not so silly as to say, that faith, repentance, Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, are not <hi>our acts.</hi> I will affirm they are not only our <hi>proper</hi> acts, but also the proper acts of none but our selves. But yet that assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, influence, vigour, by which we perform them, is so <hi>little</hi> our <hi>own,</hi> so much above the power of corrupted nature, that man is divested of all pretence of glorying, or pretending to it. I shall not need to produce a Scripture-confirmation, Chapter and verse, of our being <hi>born</hi> of God, of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101491:32"/> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> not of the will of man, but God's; our being sanctified by <hi>him,</hi> as well as elected or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified. 'Tis agreed on all hands, that our closing with, and embracing the Gospel, which derives its peace to us, may be called Gods work, and is so beyond all dispute, tho not without some <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This peace of the Gospel, is an holy peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A peace that is neither patched up for unholy ends, nor by any unholy <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> There is nothing in it unbecoming the Divine being on the one hand, nor man on the other. No temptation to any thing that is <hi>indecert,</hi> except it be uncomely to <hi>part</hi> with a <hi>leprosie,</hi> or a <hi>shame</hi> to be ashamed of things most <hi>shameful;</hi> or a sin to be <hi>sanctified;</hi> or an unhappiness to be saved; or below us to be so much beholden to the most high God, and to be bound to acknowledg it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>'Tis a just peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A peace wherein man hath infinitely more than <hi>his right,</hi> and yet God hath no wrong. A peace wherein God is unspeakably <hi>gracious</hi> to man, and perfectly <hi>just</hi> to himself. No Attribute of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives any affront, tho the sinner goes unpunisht, and the sin clean remitted. <hi>To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness, that he might be just, and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>'Tis a faithful peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is nothing in this peace that will deceive or betray us. As the Gospel tells us the best (as far as words can express, and such narrow souls as we at present can apprehend) so it tells us the worst we may meet with in this way of Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holiness.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101491:32"/> It tells you of a Crown of Life, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and Glory; and it tells you also of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a <hi>bitter Cross,</hi> of being <hi>killed all the day long,</hi> of a life in <hi>this</hi> world, filled with <hi>spiritual</hi> warrings, and the great fight is against the foes, which are so insinuated into our bowels, our very <hi>souls,</hi> that we call them our selves. <hi>Mortifie therefore your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 3. 5.</note>
                  <hi>which are on the earth.</hi> What members are they? are they right eyes, or right hands? Indeed they are not so in a <hi>proper</hi> sense, but they are so in that rank and <hi>value</hi> they hold in the <hi>corrupted</hi> nature; and must be pluckt out, and cut off with our <hi>own</hi> hands, if we would enter into life. The Apostle enumerates some few of them; <hi>Fornication, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Gospel tells you of the sweets of peace with God through Jesus Christ, and it tells you also of the <hi>enmities</hi> of the world, wherein you must expect to live as lambs among wolves. It tells you of the joys of Gods <hi>countenance,</hi> and the <hi>smiles</hi> of his face: It tells you also of the frowns of men, and of God too; if you deal unfaithfully with him, and unbecoming <hi>his</hi> children. It tells you of a glorious reward, an everlasting rest: But also that you must work, and run, and war, and wait, and deny your selves, and crucifie the <hi>flesh</hi> with its affections and <hi>lusts.</hi> In short, it tells you of God being your <hi>Father,</hi> the unsearchable riches of Christ your <hi>portion,</hi> the holy spirit your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and <hi>comforter;</hi> but also that you must wholly resign your selves to the will of God, and your Redeemer; to do and suffer what he pleases; you must live by <hi>faith,</hi> and not by <hi>sense;</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:101491:33"/> and cast the chief anchor of your hope on the <hi>other</hi> side the grave.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>'Tis a well grounded peace.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 57. 21.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Most mens peace is built in the <hi>air,</hi> and dreams of their <hi>own</hi> imaginations. Their peace is a peace<note place="margin">Job 25. 2. &amp; 22. 21.</note> without a <hi>foundation.</hi> But the Gospel peace hath foundations, against which neither time nor storms, men nor Devils can prevail. The whole Fabrick is composed by Divine Wisdom, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by Divine power, and derived to the Saints by the Word and Oath of the only true God, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed<note place="margin">Isa. 26. 3.</note> in their souls by the Holy Spirit of Grace and Peace.</p>
               <p>'Tis not a peace grounded on <hi>sensuality,</hi> legal<note place="margin">Joh. 14. 7.</note> righteousness, or <hi>superstition;</hi> all which are but <hi>rowling sands,</hi> and all the peace built on them will soon disband, and fall to ruins, and more woful disappointments. But 'tis such a peace that the<note place="margin">Isa. 7. 27.</note> more enlightened, awakened, and <hi>scrutinous</hi> the soul is, the more she is confirmed, and consolated in her peace. Yea the troubles, and emptyings of the <hi>false</hi> satisfactions of this world, do but make her so much the more happy, as to retire to this peace and rest wherein she is at home, and begins everlasting rest here.</p>

               <p>The Law or <hi>Covenant</hi> that was <hi>too weak</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our Peace, through the weakness of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> is not now the Covenant of <hi>our</hi> Peace: But such a Covenant as <hi>supposes</hi> our Infirmities, and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a Justification in the sight of God, in a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness beyond our own. <hi>If any man sin, we have an</hi>

                     <p>On what Foundation the Peace of the Gospel is laid.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1st, THE Foundations of the Peace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel are laid in the eternal Counsels, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, and good pleasure of God, and more especially of the Father.</hi> He is therefore said to be<note place="margin">Eph. 3. 9, 11.</note>
                     <hi>The God of Peace that brought again from the Dead our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> This Gospel of Peace was first laid in the <hi>eternal purposes</hi> [of God] <hi>which he purposed in Christ, and hid in God.</hi> It was a Sceret that was formed in his <hi>own</hi> Bosom, and reserved to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101491:36"/> himself, till due time for its Manifestation. When this Counsel of God was revealed in its <hi>new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>-dispensation, the Apostle refers all to Gods <hi>purpose,</hi> as the Original and <hi>Rule</hi> of it. <hi>Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 8. 10.</note>
                     <hi>his good pleasure, which he had purposed in himself. In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated according to the purpose of him, who work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things after the Counsel of his own will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is enough, and that which is clear enough to an <hi>indifferent, impartial</hi> understanding, for the proof of what is asserted. The Foundation of our Peace, and the Gospel methods of it, were not laid in Faith <hi>foreseen:</hi> Were not laid in the Ideas, Imaginations or Contrivances of Man or <hi>Angel;</hi> none of these ever <hi>thought</hi> of, or <hi>proposed,</hi> or were his instructors <hi>in</hi> this great and momentous matter. It was begun in Gods counsel and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, before Mans fall; yea, before Men or Angels had a being. There was nothing before this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and Purpose either in order of <hi>time</hi> or <hi>causality.</hi> In short, the eternal Thought and divine Grace conceived it in God himself; there was the first beginning, the first cause of the Gospel of Peace.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It had its foundation in that agreement that was made between God the Father, and God the Son, before the World was.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>order</hi> wherein the Persons in the Divine Being were concerned in carrying on this Gospel of Peace: The Father <hi>proposed</hi> to the Son, the Son <hi>consented</hi> to the Father, what should be done and suffered by the <hi>Son,</hi> in the <hi>Name,</hi> and by the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Father. This is commonly call'd, The Covenant of Redemption. In this Covenant the Father and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101491:37"/> the Son were the <hi>Foederati,</hi> or parties to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>According to this <hi>Covenant,</hi> the Son <hi>voluntarily</hi> submitted himself to the <hi>Law,</hi> and Subjection to his Father. And he said, <hi>It is a light thing that</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 49. 6.</note>
                     <hi>thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the Tribes of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and to restore the preserved of</hi> Israel. <hi>I will also give thee for a light to the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est be my Salvation to the ends of the earth.</hi> These words may sufficiently <hi>determine</hi> who and what the Prophecy in this Chapter concerns; and that it is the Redemption of Sinners, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by Jesus Christ; according to the Capitulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and the Son, here expressed.</p>
                  <p>As the result of this Covenant and Law, to which the Son of God submitted: The Son of God makes profession of the <hi>Pleasure</hi> he took in the Execution of his Engagement to his Father. <hi>In the volume of the Book, it is written of me, Lo, I come</hi>

                  <q>The third foundation of the Gospel of peace was laid, in the Son of Gods actually performing his part of the Covenant of redemption, and the improvements of it.</q>
                  <p>By that <hi>part</hi> of the Covenant of Redemption, which the Son of God had by his consent unto, and agreement with the Father ingaged to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, I <hi>mean</hi> his taking, or assuming the human nature, more especially <hi>the seed of Abraham;</hi> and in that nature, not only to fulfil personally and <hi>active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> the Law of <hi>nature</hi> as a man, and also the <hi>Jewish</hi> Positive and Ceremonial Law as a <hi>Jew,</hi> and under the obligation of a member of that Church: But also to suffer and take upon him all that affliction, and misery that filled up his state of humiliation, from his Conception to his Ascension.</p>
                  <p>I add also the improvements of this performance, because his being invested in the Kingly, Priestly, and Propheti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This Exaltation of the Lord Jesus, makes high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for our peace, in all the parts of its administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the merits of our peace, in whatever me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods it derives to us, is in the active and passive obedience of Christ; tho ordinarily ascribed to his <hi>sufferings:</hi> As our Justification to his <hi>blood:</hi> his bearing <hi>our sins</hi> in his body on the Tree; our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing healed by his <hi>stripes;</hi> his soul being made an <hi>offering</hi> for sin.</p>
                  <p>It is disputed what need there is of Christs <hi>active</hi> obedience, for laying the foundation of <hi>merit</hi> of this Gospel of peace, and the blessings contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; seeing his <hi>passive</hi> obedience was sufficient to discharge us from the <hi>punishment of sin,</hi> of which the <hi>pana damni,</hi> or that of <hi>loss</hi> was a part.</p>
                  <p>1. I answer, that his active obedience was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to <hi>qualifie</hi> him for the merit of his passive. Had he not been a Lamb <hi>without spot</hi> himself, he could not have been a meet sacrifice <hi>expiatory</hi> for others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> Both active and passive obedience as they were <hi>voluntary</hi> on <hi>his</hi> part; he undertaking them not by any <hi>necessity of nature,</hi> but by consent, was made under the <hi>Law;</hi> both of them had the nature

                     <hi>3dly,</hi> As Jesus Christ is the Head and Father of the Faithful, and they his members and posterity; whatever he merited for himself as Mediator, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in <hi>one</hi> person (which alone was capable of a reward, or an accession of any felicity it had not before) is communicated to them, which is a <hi>strain</hi> of happiness beyond what was, or could <hi>be lost</hi> by the transgression of the Law of Works.

                  <p>It is certain that not the least iota of the Gospel, or <hi>remedying</hi> Law, could arrive to the knowledg of <hi>man,</hi> by any <hi>mere</hi> natural light, or help.

This <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> expresses the Divine bowels of compassion and grace, to be <hi>suitable</hi> to that of his <hi>nature,</hi> which is <hi>essential</hi> abstracted love. <hi>God is love.</hi> And it is to be observed that this was said by God (not <hi>to</hi> our first Parents, but highly concerning them) before there was any expression, or <hi>appearance</hi> of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that we read of.</p>
                  <p>The next Gospel-revelation we read of was in the sacrifice of <hi>Abel,</hi> which we may presume was in compliance with some Divine express obligation,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101491:39"/> and perhaps its ends explained. For it is said that <hi>by faith Abel offered a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> We have also the <hi>Typical</hi> representation of Christ, by <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark; and the saving of <hi>some</hi> therein, when the <hi>far</hi> greater number <hi>perished</hi> by the <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal</hi> deluge.

                     <hi>Circumcision</hi> the token of the Covenant, which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified that <hi>Gospel</hi>-sanctification, and separation to God, from <hi>sin,</hi> and the <hi>ungodly</hi> world, which by faith wrought in the heart and life, is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant of Grace on our part, and gives a right to Justification and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>These were short and <hi>enigmatical</hi> discoveries of Gospel-grace: the first dawnings which shined in the Old Testament <hi>brighter</hi> and <hi>brighter,</hi> until the <hi>perfect day</hi> of the New Testament Meridian-glory, according to those words, <hi>God who at sundry times, and divers manners, spake in times past unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in these last days spoken to us by his Son,—the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The Gospel was revealed in Types, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and figures, all of Gods appointment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the next step, which tho <hi>wholly</hi> Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphical, and therefore <hi>dark,</hi> yet the order and number of them were such as gave an account in their language of Jesus Christ in all his Offices; the New Testament Church in its order and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in a good degree, but especially of its Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and separation from the world, by a <hi>real</hi> difference.

                     <hi>Evangelium velatum;</hi> and indeed it was <hi>so</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> for <hi>when they read, to this day the vail is upon</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>By large and express Prophesies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Somewhat we have of this by <hi>Jacob</hi> in the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of his Sons, but not much, till <hi>Moses</hi> time. <hi>Jacob</hi> tells us of <hi>Shilo</hi>'s coming; <hi>Balaam</hi> (tho a bad man) a Prophet of a great good, <hi>The Star that should arise out of Jacob. Moses</hi> speaks of a Prophet like unto <hi>him,</hi> that God would raise up. But <hi>David</hi> and the rest of the Prophets after him (especially <hi>Isaiah</hi>) do speak with that <hi>clearness</hi> of Jesus Christ, and the Grace that is by him, that in many places they might be thought to have written <hi>Histories</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Prophesies.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>This Gospel of peace was revealed in the greatest clearness and perfection that we are capable of in this world, by Jesus Christ and his Apostles, in the matter contained in the New Testament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Herein it was not only more <hi>fully</hi> declared, but its Doctrines and Ordinances stript of those dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and <hi>masks</hi> under which they were shadowed. Herein it appeared open and <hi>naked</hi> in its <hi>simplicity,</hi> its proper beauty and glory. As it was under the Old Testament <hi>Evangelium velatum; so it is under the New, Evangelium revelatum. But we all with open</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This was such a <hi>revelation,</hi> such a clear and <hi>bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced</hi> representation of that life and immortality designed by the <hi>New</hi> Covenant; such a <hi>noon-day</hi> brightness, that which preceded was comparatively
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101491:40"/> but a night enlightned by some lesser Stars: No glory by reason of this which <hi>so much</hi> excelleth. And well may this be esteemed the <hi>day-light</hi> of the Gospel, the Sun of Righteousness <hi>himself</hi> being risen upon us.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>By the Ministry of the Word and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in the hands of those whom Jesus Christ hath gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, gifted, and called to that venerable imploy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>matter</hi> of the Gospel revealed in the New Testament, would have been <hi>comparatively</hi> but a <hi>dead</hi> stock, a <hi>sealed</hi> Book without this <hi>Ministry.</hi> Most men might say of it, as the Eunuch of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie he read, <hi>How can I understand unless some one should guide me?</hi> To the preaching of this New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-revelation in the due <hi>sense,</hi> construction and application of it, our Lord Jesus promised to be<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 18, 19, 20.</note> with his Ministers <hi>successively</hi> to the <hi>end</hi> of the world. The Apostles lived but the common age of men, yet sufficient to lay and leave us the foundation, and by their Preaching and Miracles to give the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel a considerable <hi>entrance</hi> into the world, and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> in the hearts of multitudes. But the standing <hi>continuing</hi> Ministry is <hi>necessary</hi> to continuate and carry on the efficacy of that stock of truth derived from those <hi>master</hi>-builders. These are now (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the fixed Pastors of particular Churches) the<note place="margin">Rev. 1.</note>

                  <p>Sixthly, This Gospel of peace is yet farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, <hi>by the Ministry of the Spirit accompanying that of the Word.</hi> The matter of Gospel-revelation, is in the Scriptures so <hi>entire,</hi> and compleat, as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of nothing <hi>new;</hi> but it doth admit of such a revelation of its <hi>sense,</hi> and genuine consequence, as is new to <hi>us;</hi> but especially of a new and <hi>farther</hi> efficacy upon the souls of men, another taste, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, and power than that which is contained in the bare letter.</p>
                  <p>This revelation by the Ministry of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> hath two parts.</p>
                  <p>1. Assisting to the enlightning the mind and <hi>understanding</hi> to the knowledg of the <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>written</hi> Word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> Working <hi>by</hi> the Word, to the opening the heart to its <hi>truths</hi> and obligations, prevailing on it to <hi>embrace</hi> Gospel-truths effectually and savingly.</p>
                  <p>For the first of these, the natural abilities may go <hi>far,</hi> and acquired learning may help it on much <hi>farther,</hi> without any <hi>special</hi> assistance of the Spirit of God; yet the assistance of the Spirit in its <hi>common</hi> work may and does so <hi>mend</hi> the market, that they that are blessed therewith, may pierce
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101491:41"/> much <hi>deeper,</hi> and with much more <hi>ease</hi> into the sense of Gospel-truths than those under the same circumstances <hi>otherwise,</hi> can do without it. And if the genius and skill in those far lower things, <hi>scil.</hi> of Gold, Silver, Brass, was imputed to the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions<note place="margin">Exod. 31. 2, 3, 4.</note> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, much more doth it by its assistance <hi>advance</hi> the intellect in what is more <hi>sublime,</hi> and doth more properly belong to it. And therefore we are directed to pray to God for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of this understanding, both for our selves, and Ministers. And this doth <hi>imply</hi> that we need a spirit more active, and penetrating than our own, to reach the sense of Divine Truths. Tho yet (as I said before) it may be obtained by the Spirits common assistance in a great degree.</p>
                  <p>There is also a farther understanding of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by the work of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a speculation, or a true notion of the things themselves, but a taste, relish and <hi>sensation</hi> of them; which is not so barren as the former <hi>may</hi> be, but a kind of <hi>impression</hi> and efficacy, which strikes the spiritual sense with some <hi>experience</hi> of that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ower, and <hi>sweetness</hi> which is in Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Truths. And certainly this kind of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding which lies in a taste and <hi>sensation,</hi> as it is a work of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> beyond that of a meer dry specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; so it is such an one as is more prevailing and <hi>lively,</hi> and that which persons may receive that are far short of others in the <hi>speculative</hi> knowledg. And it may be are no way able to express it <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly</hi> to others, or form any distinct conception of it to <hi>themselves.</hi> As it is with Infants and Children, who do by a <hi>sensation</hi> of the sweetness of the breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milk understand its <hi>goodness</hi> and difference from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101491:42"/> things, yet without any exact and <hi>distinct</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it in the understanding. I may add for more <hi>elucidation</hi> of this truth, the notions that Book-learning hath of Countries, and the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Fruits, and their as various <hi>relishes.</hi> No man will say but that the notions which they have of those Countries, and those Fruits, and their relishes, are of <hi>another</hi> kind, and far short of theirs who have seen and tasted them by their own experience.</p>
                  <p>I must say somewhat to that revelation of the Gospel, by which it is not only opened to the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> so as to form <hi>in it</hi> some due concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it, but also by the work of the Spirit of God enlivening and <hi>animating</hi> the Truths of the Gospel, the will and affections are prevailed on to embrace and <hi>conform</hi> themselves to them; and as the Text expresses it, <hi>are changed into the same image</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note>
                     <hi>from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Grace is here called <hi>glory,</hi> of which there are degrees. And the lowest degree is so glorious, that where it is wrought in the Ministry of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, it implies no less than the Spirit of the Lord working in it and <hi>by it.</hi> And indeed when all is said, this conforming the heart to the love and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing <hi>practical</hi> embraces of the Gospel, as it is the most contrary and difficult to <hi>corrupted</hi> nature; so it is that wherein the more <hi>peculiar</hi> work of the Spirit of God is <hi>necessary,</hi> and doth evidence its self. How easie it is for men of <hi>quick</hi> apprehensions, <hi>refined</hi> intellects, and exercised in Theological learning, to discourse, dispute, and preach Evangelical Truths with no mean accuracy and instruction to <hi>others,</hi> and yet themselves be chained up to a worldly <hi>sensual</hi> affection and conversation, is the sad and <hi>common</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:101491:42"/> experience. 'Tis certainly more easie for a person so qualified, to write a Volume of Excellent Truths, than to mortifie <hi>one lust,</hi> or reconcile his affections to a delight in <hi>holiness.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>As the ultimate and <hi>consummate</hi> end of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101491:43"/> is the Salvation, and compleat and eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of the Faithful; so till they arrive to that blessed estate, their knowledg, and the <hi>means</hi> of it, is <hi>short</hi> of that perfection it shall <hi>then and there</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. The present powers and faculties of our souls are too <hi>narrow</hi> to receive, and too weak to <hi>bear</hi> those manifestations and impressions of the glory of the reconciled face of God. That new wine which they shall drink with their Lord and Head Jesus Christ in the Kingdom of their Father, would <hi>burst</hi> these <hi>old</hi> vessels.

                  <p>It is reserved to that state to know as we are known, to see that God face to face, the beholding whom in such a manner and measure, will compleat our likeness to him.

                  <p>The complaint made of the Gospel as such a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101491:44"/> make-bait and breaker of the peace, is very ancient, and took it by the heel in its first steps and motions after Christs Ascension. What was there less in that out-cry, <hi>They drew Jason—crying, These that have</hi>

                  <p>We know that God the Author of all things, is <hi>perfectly</hi> good, essential <hi>Love.</hi> If it be asked, how comes it to pass that there is so much evil of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and <hi>Misery</hi> in the World? The answer is ready, There is nothing but what is good that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101491:44"/> derives from God, as its <hi>Original;</hi> and all evil of <hi>Affliction</hi> hath <hi>another Spring,</hi> which is <hi>Sin.</hi> And tho God be the most principal <hi>efficient</hi> Cause of all the Sorrows of Men; yet the <hi>original</hi> Cause, is <hi>ab extra.</hi> All good and <hi>goodness</hi> that derives to the Creature, is <hi>originally</hi> in God, it hath its first cause in his Love, Goodness, Benignity: But Afflictions (tho from God) are by a kind of necessity. His Justice indeed is ingaged therein, but it is by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of Sin, by which the Divine Being is <hi>wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and affronted by his Creatures. Thus much only in the <hi>Negative,</hi> to the unjust Imputations on the Gospel of Peace, and for the Explication of the question.</p>
                  <p>I must now shew you, <hi>whence</hi> then it is that the Gospel, and Contention, if they be not of kin, or agreed, do thus frequently dwell, and <hi>walk</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. How come they to be such <hi>usual</hi> Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, if they are not cause and effect? I shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer first generally, or give some general Causes of such <hi>sad</hi> events, where the Gospel enters, and then the more special Causes of unpeaceableness in the several places to be instanced in, and in indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Persons also.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>It arises from the great interest and power that Sin, the corrupter of Nature, hath in the Soul of faln Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From whence come wars and fightings among you?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 4. 1.</note>
                     <hi>come they not hence, even of your lusts, that War in your members?</hi> The Gospel is not only designed and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted</hi> to save, but also to sanctifie the Souls of Men; not only to quench the Flames of <hi>Hell</hi> in the World to come, but also every spark of Lust and Sin in us, while we are in <hi>this</hi> World.</p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:101491:45"/>
                  <p>Now, as the varying and <hi>contradicting</hi> Members of the Body of Sin, do militate in the same Subject one against another; so they all agree with all their might to oppose the Gospel, which is their <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Adversary. And that which is the greatest <hi>Misery,</hi> and of all other to be <hi>bemoaned</hi> is, that Sin, the Corruption of Nature, hath so far insinuated it self into our good <hi>Opinion,</hi> hath so much of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by <hi>Nature,</hi> Custom, and long time of <hi>Possession;</hi> hath so <hi>assimilated</hi> us to its own deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hateful <hi>Image,</hi> that we are fond of its <hi>mis-rule,</hi> and proud of its <hi>Chains;</hi> 'tis become our <hi>familiar;</hi> and tho it be the worst of the Devil himself, we are perswaded it will do us no harm. It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so near <hi>essential</hi> to us, as if it were indeed no Foreigner, no <hi>Enemy,</hi> but a part of our very <hi>selves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore the Scripture speaking our Language and Sense, calls the wretched Members of the <hi>old Man,</hi> or Natures Corruption, our <hi>right Eyes,</hi> and our <hi>right Hands;</hi> and the mortifying Sin, our Death and <hi>Crucifying;</hi> and the restraint of our Lusts, <hi>a denying our selves.</hi> And can we now wonder at the Opposition rising so high against the Gospel, whose business it is to pluck up these Weeds by the Roots, to purge out this old Leaven, to separate us from those darling Lusts that lie so near our hearts, to commence a War irreconcilable in our own Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els against this Enemy, that will not be wholly vanquished, till the Fort and Garison it possesses be dissoved? Yea, moreover, when the Sinner shall look on all his Pleasures, deriving from that relish his Sins give them, and that his awakenings out of its sweet <hi>Dreams,</hi> is no less than letting out
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101491:45"/> his Soul, and letting loose all the Terrors of Hell upon him: Well, saith a sinful deluded Soul, I must overcome, and banish all the <hi>Powers</hi> of this Gospel, or it will destroy my so necessary Sins. This makes him buckle to its Opposition, and raise all the Powers of Earth and Hell against it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From Satan, that great Enemy to the Honour of God, and Welfare of Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Satan well knows that the Gospel is Gods <hi>great</hi> Engine to batter his Kingdom in pieces; to take the prey from the <hi>Mighty,</hi> to deliver his Bondslaves from the power of <hi>Darkness,</hi> and to translate<note place="margin">Col. 1. 13.</note> them into the Kingdom of the dear Son of God. He knows that for this <hi>cause</hi> the Son of God was manifested in the Flesh, that he might <hi>destroy</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 8.</note> the works of the <hi>Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have a remarkable <hi>Description</hi> of Satans Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the Gospel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. First his <hi>diligent</hi>

                  <p>But this course not prevailing neither, (for the Gospel and its <hi>faithful</hi> profession never lost either
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101491:46"/> its reputation, or <hi>number</hi> of adherents by <hi>persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>) he insinuates himself into the Church <hi>it self,</hi> and by an hypocritical, rotten-hearted generation, aiming at nothing less than the high and <hi>holy</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of the Gospel, mingles himself with its <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> professors.

                  </p>
                  <p>This Battel, tho it began in some small <hi>Bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> and skirmishes in the days of the Apostles; yet till <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time, when much of this world was poured into the lap of the <hi>Church,</hi> and was a prize thought worth <hi>contending</hi> for by men whose principles tasted <hi>nothing</hi> above earth; the Dragons party were not so <hi>great</hi> and numerous as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any great matters against the truth, <hi>as it is in Jesus.</hi> But what it hath done since, is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <hi>apparent;</hi> and what it may do for the <hi>future,</hi> the Providence of God (for ought I know) will be the only Key to open.</p>
                  <p>By what hath been said, the <hi>cause</hi> of the contests and <hi>disquietments</hi> attending this Gospel of <hi>Peace,</hi> is manifest. And where the corruptions of the lusts of <hi>men,</hi> abetted by <hi>worldly</hi> interests, and inflamed by the <hi>spirit</hi> of Satan to such an opposition, do meet, we need not wonder at its unreasonableness and <hi>fierceness.</hi> We have a <hi>common saying</hi> of those men who act at a rate of Villany and violence beyond the common rate of <hi>human</hi> force, That <hi>the Devil is in them;</hi> and certainly where <hi>his energy</hi> is added to <hi>human</hi> opposition to the Gospel, as we have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the contest and confusion, the disquietness and oppositions cannot likely be short, of what we have seen and heard of.</p>

                  <p>I shall now consider more particularly the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of this disquietness.</p>
                  <p>First, In the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Among the Heathen world.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>First, The causes of disquietness upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels entrance amongst the <hi>Jews:</hi> That there was such disquietness and <hi>oppositions,</hi> is so well known to all that read the Scriptures with any degree of understanding, that I need not give you a <hi>syllable</hi> for the proof of <hi>that.</hi> The first cause I shall assign is, <hi>The disappointment of their great, but ungrounded expectation of the Messias to come in the Majesty of a worldly Potentate, and delivering the</hi> Jewish <hi>Nation from the yoke of</hi> Rome-<hi>Heathen, and advancing it in exernal splendor above all other Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The mistake that ran current among the <hi>Jews,</hi> of the <hi>true</hi> meaning of those Prophetick Texts of Scripture, which <hi>prima facie,</hi> or literally, spake of the <hi>Jewish,</hi> or <hi>Israelitish</hi> Church and their Kings, as clothed with all the worldly pomp and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance imaginable; But their mystical and <hi>true</hi> sense being of the spiritual seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> by promise; and that <hi>spiritual</hi> glory of them, and their King the Lord Jesus. I say this mistake was the cause of their ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable prejudice against Christ and his Gospel.</p>
                  <p>We find the Disciples of Christ themselves were not <hi>wholly</hi> cured of such false conceits; no, not after their Lord was crucified; and they ran so strong in their minds, that they inquire of him, <hi>Wilt thou at this time restore the Kingdom to Israel?</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Act. 1. 6.</note> that external freedom and glory abovesaid.</p>
                  <p>Now the unconverted and <hi>worldly</hi>-minded <hi>Jews</hi> could not endure to have their ungrounded expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations <hi>so far</hi> disappointed and <hi>contradicted,</hi> as to

And we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</hi> But
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101491:48"/> how unreasonable were these causes of quarelling Christ and his Gospel, which were so necessary qualifications of <hi>both,</hi> seeing that without <hi>them</hi> the Errand of the Messias into the world would have been wholly <hi>frustrate,</hi> and their reconciliation to God and eternal Salvation desperate and <hi>unattainable?</hi> How unreasonable to be offended at the Son of God, for stooping so <hi>low,</hi> and giving such a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of <hi>condescending</hi> love? Why should they not rather than <hi>stumble</hi> at such an humble <hi>crucified</hi> Christ, and a Gospel answerable, be offended at their own pride and <hi>vanity,</hi> in preferring an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before an <hi>heavenly</hi> glory; and at their being so blind and hardned, and ignorant of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> they boasted their skill and value of?

                     <hi>King but Caesar;</hi> tho still at the <hi>bottom</hi> lay those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy principles of unreasonable fear, and self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101491:49"/> and I may add, <hi>profound</hi> ignorance of Christ and his Kingdom. Why no King but <hi>Caesar?</hi> Could they not have had Christ for their King, and <hi>Caesar</hi> too? To be a <hi>good</hi> Christian, and a good <hi>subject,</hi> are so far from an <hi>inconsistency</hi> that the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christian any man is, the better subject he will be. Yea to be a good subject, and good in every relation, is a good part of Christianity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Another cause was that, <hi>Christs Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine did so much slight and oppose their hypocrisie, and ungrounded expositions, and traditions of the Elders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Scribes, Pharisees and Elders of the <hi>Jews,</hi> had so great an opinion and interest with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they became their very <hi>shadow;</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their dictates as Oracles, and were perfectly inslaved to their impositions. If we look into their expositions, how narrow and corrupt were they? How far from that perfect and sincere holiness the Law obliges to? How far from that love to their neighbour (so much the substance of the Law) was that Comment, <hi>Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What were their Traditions but trifles at <hi>best?</hi> such as washings before eating, cleansings of cups and vessels? But that of their <hi>Corban</hi> was the most <hi>inhuman,</hi> that for a gift to the Temple, which they pretended was to God, they were discharged for <hi>ever</hi> of any obligation to <hi>relieve</hi> their own Parents in their greatest <hi>necessities</hi> or misery. These with their abominable hypocrisies, the Doctrine of Christ was an enemy to, and for that cause the whole body of the <hi>Jews</hi> were enemies to that, and its Author.</p>
                  <p>But was there any reason they should quarrel with Christ and the Gospel for these causes?
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101491:49"/> What <hi>good</hi> did their hypocrisie do them, but make them stink in the nostrils of God, for seeking by such dissimulations to perfume their reputations with <hi>men?</hi> What were their Traditions worth, which they did not so much as <hi>pretend</hi> any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for, from God; but were only to gratifie that pride that loves to be observed and honoured; tho by robbing God of his honour, and making void his Commandments by their Traditions?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The dissolution of the Jewish Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, with all its Temple-worship.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Church-state consisted of two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of an external <hi>figurative</hi> Worship, with Rites and Priesthood suitable belonging to it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of their being the <hi>only</hi> Church of God in the world, separated from <hi>all</hi> other Nations and people by Gods choice, with some rites of this signification.</p>
                  <p>The first of these carried with it a glory that was very <hi>dazling</hi> to the eyes of beholders, admired for its pomp, richness and contrivance; not only by the <hi>Jews,</hi> but by all Nations. Two things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to it they excelled all Nations in, first, in the matter and form of their <hi>Rites,</hi> and order of their Priesthood. No Temple on earth so celebrated as that at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> no order of Priesthood, and their Vestments so <hi>venerable.</hi> But <hi>2dly,</hi> and that which added a greater glory, They were Gods <hi>own appointment;</hi> they had his authority to justifie and sanctifie them, and the wisdom of his contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to put a <hi>beauty</hi> on them.</p>
                  <p>It was not the <hi>moral</hi> Law of the <hi>Jews</hi> that so signalized them among other Nations, for that they had <hi>all</hi> of them written in their <hi>hearts</hi> (tho
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101491:50"/> not in so clear a Character) as the <hi>Jews</hi> on the Tables of Stone; but it was the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law. This kind of Worship and Rites the whole world in those days had their Religion made up of, of outward pomp and Ceremony, of <hi>mystical</hi> sense, and some of them secret to all but their principal Priests, and these were their most venerable my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries. In these things the <hi>Jews</hi> had no temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to change theirs for any of their neighbours. And the second consideration of Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and contrivance out-did theirs beyond all measure.</p>
                  <p>But here I must make a short stop to tell you, that the Heathen pretended no less for <hi>all</hi> their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and its <hi>rites.</hi> The whole of their <hi>Sacra</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way pretended the <hi>appointments</hi> of their imagined Deities. Nature was not then so blind as (tho it mistook so greatly the Gods they worshipped) as to mistake so far as to believe that their Deities would accept any worship at their hands, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and <hi>forms</hi> of which they receiv'd not first from their Oracles. But what were Imaginary Deities to the true God? What was a National, Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, or City-ministerial Demy-god to the only true Sup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eme God, and Lord of Heaven and Earth?</p>
                  <p>This Glory of <hi>External Typical Rites</hi> and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, the Gospel utterly stripped them of, and left them to the naked <hi>simplicity</hi> of Spiritual Worship (except the two <hi>positives</hi> of the Lords-Supper and Baptism) <hi>The time cometh, and now is, that they that worship the Father must worship him in spirit and in truth. In spirit,</hi> not in carnal rites, material things without life: <hi>In truth,</hi> not in shadows and <hi>resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances,</hi> which are b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t <hi>appearances,</hi> not the things themselves.</p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:101491:50"/>
                  <p>This the <hi>Jews</hi> could not bear; yea, the <hi>converted Jews</hi> were hardly brought off from <hi>them,</hi> when they were <hi>espoused</hi> to Jesus Christ and his Gospel. They were willing to entertain him and his more manly and real furniture and order, but also they would fain have retained their <hi>childish</hi> shadows. And indeed we have <hi>little</hi> cause to wonder at their loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to part with such a <hi>splendid</hi> order and worship (<hi>once</hi> of Gods appointment) at the call of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and their rising up in opposition to it, for this (tho but supposed) <hi>wrong;</hi> having so near our doors <hi>less</hi> things of meer and <hi>confessed</hi> human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention so hotly contended for.</p>
                  <p>But what reason had they to be offended at the Gospel, for removing <hi>beggarly</hi> Elements, <hi>carnal</hi> Ordinances, to make way for Spiritual and <hi>real</hi> exercises and enjoyments, suited to an intelligent <hi>rational</hi> soul? What reason to rise up in such a <hi>fury,</hi> for removing the Picture, when the person it represented was to take up its room? to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at parting with that which was no glory, by reason of that which excelleth, and which the Gospel brought along with it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> The priviledg of being Gods <hi>peculiar</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the only <hi>Church</hi> in the world, being <hi>abolished</hi> by the Gospel; made the blood <hi>boil</hi> in their veins at the very <hi>mention</hi> of it. <hi>Isaias</hi> was said to be very<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 20.</note> bold, who dare adventure to deliver a message of <hi>this</hi> import from God <hi>himself, I was found of them that sought me not, I was made manifest to them that inquired not after me.</hi> And tho they had little pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence<note place="margin">Act. 22. 21, 22, 23.</note> for the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>'s defence, yet, <hi>they heard him to that word. And he said unto me, Depart, for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.</hi> Now they could
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101491:51"/> hold no longer, all patience was broken. <hi>Away with such a fellow from the earth, it is not fit he should live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore all this anger? was it because he would preach the Gospel no more to them? No, that was it they had no mind to; but to carry it to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to break down the <hi>partition</hi>-wall, to preach a Law from heaven that shined with an <hi>equal</hi> grace on all mankind, this galled them, and filled them with the bitterness of envy. But alas, what evil did the Gospel do in this? what wrong did it to the <hi>Jews?</hi> Had not the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness <hi>light</hi> enought to impart to all the world? and all at one time too, in which he excels the Sun in the Firmament? I shall say no more on this head, but the <hi>apparent</hi> as well as <hi>designed</hi> conclusion, That this cause of their disquietness on the Gospel approach, was altogether <hi>unreasonable.</hi> The Gospel was no <hi>criminal</hi> party to the breach of he peace.</p>

                  <p>The Scriptures (especially the History of the <hi>Acts of the Apostles</hi>) do so fully bear witness to the matter of fact, that I am unwilling to imply a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition of my Readers unacquaintedness of so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious a truth; tho I shall take leave to add, that there was none, or little of violent opposition from the <hi>heathen</hi> for forty years, but what was stirred up by the <hi>Jews,</hi> who dwelt in their several Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Cities. <hi>Nero</hi> was the first <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor that by <hi>publick</hi> prosecutions opposed it: And in many places it was entertained friendly by <hi>them.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:101491:51"/>
                  <p>It might well seem hard to <hi>men</hi> to have their gods (tho but imaginary ones) <hi>blasphemed,</hi> as they took it. For the Gospel declared the one only true God, excluding not only by what that implied, but <hi>expresly</hi> all their Idols to be <hi>false</hi> gods; yea, <hi>devils</hi> and not <hi>gods;</hi> For such <hi>Daemons</hi> they were that joyned themselves to their Idols, and gave forth their Oracles. What we read of the man <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah,</hi> when his Levite left him, and took his <hi>Images</hi> with him, is the <hi>exact</hi> Specimen of the humour of <hi>Idolaters,</hi> that are (pardon the term) <hi>religiously</hi> so. <hi>What aileth thee</hi> (said the <hi>Danites</hi> to <hi>Micah) that</hi>

What is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?</hi> All the complaints and <hi>emotions</hi> of the soul imaginable, are no such extravagant things as to be wondred at in <hi>such</hi> a case.</p>
                  <p>And I may here take leave to observe, that as <hi>too ordinarily</hi> the professors of the one <hi>only</hi> true God, are criminally and <hi>unbecomingly</hi> loose, indifferent, and defective in their respects to him and his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship whom they can never value to <hi>excess:</hi> So the Votaries of false gods, and <hi>false</hi> worship, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly beyond all measures in the zeal of their Idols and <hi>Superstitions.

And therefore, tho they had <hi>altars</hi> to gods, and <hi>Lords</hi> many, too many, almost <hi>innumerable,</hi> and their <hi>Sacra</hi> and Rites so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive, they must add one altar to the <hi>unknown</hi> God,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101491:52"/> that they might compass within their Religion the very <hi>Terra incognita</hi> of Religion. This the Apostle expresses by <hi>Daemon-fear,</hi> which like the Devil is tyrannical, tormenting, holding men always on the rack of doubt that they have not done enough to secure themselves of being <hi>accepted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if we consider what hath been said, with this addition, that the Heathen as they represented their Deities commonly by <hi>human</hi> shapes and forms, so also by human <hi>passions,</hi> and the worst of mens <hi>vices</hi> as their qualifications, as theft, murder, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness, treachery, drunkenness, and all manner of debauches, and luxury; and agreeable to this, were the actions by which they pretended to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and please them, <hi>scil.</hi> Feasts, Plays, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, obscenities, and vicious excesses. These things (I say) considered, as the cause is plain, so the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness of opposing the Gospel for such causes is as plain and obvious.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The Gospel proposing the Son of God made man, and him crucified, to be the only Mediator of our reconciliation, and acceptance with God, and our eternal happiness; with the Doctrines of the Trinity in Ʋnity, Resurrection of the Body, and other Mysteries revealed, and peculiar to the Christian Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These great and fundamental Truths of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, were the <hi>mysteries hidden from</hi> many <hi>ages,</hi> and which nothing but Divine Revelation Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral could make known to us, nor any thing short of <hi>miraculous,</hi> the apparent <hi>finger</hi> of God, be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient conviction to man that these things were the Revelation of God.</p>
                  <p>The Heathen had some apprehension that some extraordinary thing was to be done to appease and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:101491:52"/> reconcile to men their angry Deities, but especially the Supream God. They had their rites and myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they had their sacrifices of <hi>blood,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of <hi>human</hi> blood, among the more civilized Nations. The former sort may be presumed to be received <hi>first</hi> by tradition, the spring and origin of which to them was utterly lost.

                  <p>But their Mediators were their demi-gods, such as were once Heroes among men, whom for their excellent vertues and usefulness when in the world, they placed in heaven as gods of a second rank, and such they thought worthy to interpose betwixt the supreme God and men, by their intercession and ministry.

                  <p>Therefore as a crucified Christ was a <hi>stumbling</hi>

                  <head>SECT. I.</head>
                  <p>The first I shall mention is, <hi>That in the visible Church there is a</hi> mixture <hi>of sincere Believers of, and Votaries to the Rules of the Gospel, and such as are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders, outside professors, and very hypocrites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Those Parables concerning the Kingdom of<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 3, 24, 28.</note> God, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>visible Church:</hi> The Gospel being like a <hi>Net</hi> that takes of all sorts of Fishes, good and bad. The Parable of the <hi>Sower;</hi> of the field of <hi>Corn:</hi> All these import the <hi>mixtures</hi> of sincere Christians, and <hi>hypocrites</hi> in the <hi>visible</hi> Christian Church; and that its state shall continue so more or less, beyond the cure of the best men, and the means <hi>they</hi> can use, till the <hi>end</hi> of the world; then the <hi>angels</hi> shall make an exact, perfect, and eternal separation of the one into the Heaven of the <hi>blessed;</hi> of the other into the Hell of the <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed.</hi>

                  <pb facs="tcp:101491:55"/>
                  <p>This mixture considered, and such as runs too much through it in all the parts and veins of it: How can it be expected that all should move in a quiet and peaceable order? The principles of the one and the other (notwithstanding the greatest unity in profession that can be imagined) are not only <hi>divers,</hi> but diametrically <hi>opposite,</hi> as believers and unbelievers, born of the flesh and of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, such as are of the world, and their affections and designs <hi>governed</hi> by it; and such as are taken <hi>out</hi> of the world, their hearts set on the things <hi>above,</hi> and their designs and motions answerable; such who are sincerely and intirely resigned to God in Christ (which is the true <hi>Sanctification</hi>) and such who are inslaved to their <hi>corrupt</hi> humours and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.

                     <p>In and among those that are sincere professors of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, there are too many sources from whence naturally this disquietness arises.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>1. Conversion and Sanctification is not <hi>so perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,</hi> in those in whom it is <hi>real;</hi> and the principles of it <hi>radicated</hi> in their souls; but there are sad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of <hi>corrupted</hi> nature in all the instances of it in the best of men, much more in those that are true Christians, but without an hyperbole <hi>the least of all Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And these remains of corruption in them (tho under some restraints by Grace) will not be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether still and idle. The flesh will be <hi>lusting against the spirit,</hi> and too often bringing good men <hi>into captivity to the Law of sin.</hi> So far as these lusts <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,</hi> they will diffuse into Kingdoms, Cities, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, Churches, all converses, those hateful fruits of disquietness, and most of all into their own
<pb facs="tcp:101491:56"/> souls, which are so near the spring-heads, and through a gracious tenderness most sensible of the disorder.</p>
                  <p>If those chief Apostles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> such emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Saints, had sinful distempers in them to raise<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 11. Act. 15. 39</note> a <hi>quarrel;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> fell out to a <hi>parting,</hi> what may be expected from the common rank of Christians? But let us all along take this with us, that it was none of the Gospel, none of their <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> that was in the <hi>fault,</hi> but a defect in their <hi>compliance</hi> with it. <hi>Whence come wars and fightings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong</hi>

                     <hi>you, come they not from your lusts, &amp;c.</hi> This is spoken of real Christians.</p>
                  <q>Secondly, And more particularly, <hi>It arises from the different sentiment of good men, of the mind of God in the Scriptures.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>I dare be bold to say, that were it not for this, all contests would be for ever buried, or very <hi>short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived</hi> among real Christians. That the Scriptures are by all professors of Christianity owned to be the Word of God, is an unspeakable mercy; for, thereby the <hi>standard</hi> of truth is preserved. That all sincere professors are willing to acknowledg it <hi>practically,</hi> is also a very happy consideration. Yet, while either ignorant <hi>defects</hi> in the knowledg of its sense, or erroneous determinations <hi>contrary</hi> to its sense, carry so great a party, and have some share in all; we must know how to separate causes and effects, or expect no such blessing as an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal peaceableness amongst all real Christians.</p>
                  <p>One only cure is left, which is to agree <hi>in aliquo tertio, i. e.</hi> to embrace that Gospel cure of the symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and effects of this disease in the <hi>eyes,</hi> which is, <hi>To forbear one another in love;</hi> to be of one heart,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101491:56"/> and one soul, with a <hi>non obstante</hi> to many differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent sentiments. And indeed God has not promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that babes and men shall ever in this world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand <hi>alike,</hi> but love and sorbearance he hath both commanded to all now, and hath promised shall be the blessing of the Saints in the days of the Churches glory in this world.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>It arises from a false construction of each others sentiments, and commonly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>It is a fault among Christians (too notorious to need proof) to believe, and report of one another that they hold opinions which they do not; but it may be <hi>detested</hi> in their very hearts. And also that those opinions which are really theirs are <hi>false,</hi> when it may be they are true, or nearer the truth than their own. This breeds ill blood, and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant spirits; alienates affections, and makes so much the greater soreness on the <hi>one</hi> part, because they know they are wronged and slandered. And indeed (as it too often happens) when once a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and difference is raised, <hi>one</hi> part will be glad of any pretence true or false to speak evil of the <hi>other;</hi> and remove to a <hi>farther</hi> distance from brotherly love; and that which is worst of all, be very <hi>sorry</hi> if an evil report or surmise of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse party do <hi>not</hi> prove <hi>true.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>It is an ordinary thing to reproach the faithful Preaching of the Gospel of Peace and purity, with the <hi>troubles</hi> it raises in mens minds, and that it makes them distracted and melancholly.

                  <q>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It disrests men by taking them off from false foundations of hope of the cure of their misery, and to an interest in Gods favour, and eternal life.</q>
                  <p>It is true that the Gospel doth as well awaken men from sleeping on a <hi>wrong</hi> pillow of security, as from an <hi>insensibleness</hi> of the misery of a state of sin. Our Lord Jesus himself warns us that we build not on the <hi>sands,</hi> but on a rock; that we<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 26. Rom. 8. 5. Joh. 3. 18. Rom. 3. 21 Phil. 3. 1, to 11.</note> may not be buried <hi>alive</hi> in the ruins of our hopes, but may be able to stand in present trial, and in the last judgment. It tells us that <hi>if we live after the flesh</hi> (whatever our knowledg or professions may be) <hi>we shall die. That he that believeth not is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already.</hi> That a <hi>meer</hi> civil life, or <hi>moral</hi> righteousness, will not <hi>justifie</hi> us in the sight of God. No, nor our personal <hi>Evangelical</hi> righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or real <hi>sanctification,</hi> by its own worth or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, but the righteousness of Christ embraced and relied on by faith. That such a faith in Christ as is without <hi>works</hi> in the <hi>adult,</hi> is not <hi>saving,</hi> but <hi>dead,</hi> and will leave us exposed to an <hi>eternal</hi> death. That all our knowledg, profession, and attendance on external Ordinances and Worship, is but a shadow
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101491:59"/> without substance, a body without a soul, if not <hi>animated</hi> by a sincere <hi>disposedness</hi> to the obedience of faith, a real prevailing respect to all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, both of the first and second Table. That he that is offended at the Cross of Christ, or<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 38</note> sufferings in and for adherence to his duty, hath no <hi>Gospel</hi>-worthiness or meetness for the Kingdom of Heaven. That a Sacramental, or <hi>Symbolical</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation by external washing, or baptism, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out spiritual real sanctification, is no <hi>such</hi> regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 21</note> as will <hi>secure</hi> salvation to us. That all who are of the <hi>visible</hi> Church (whether universal or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular) on earth, and not real Saints, under a real<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 2, to 8.</note> change to holiness of heart and life, shall notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing (if so living &amp; dying) be shut out of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>But if these faithful admonitions of the Gospel cause disquietness in the minds of <hi>those</hi> who lean on these <hi>Bulrushes,</hi> and shelter themselves in such deceitful <hi>unwarranted</hi> refuges, let them not blame the Gospel for telling them their <hi>danger,</hi> and row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them up to a sincere <hi>effectual</hi> faith and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but let them blame their wilful ignorance, error, laziness, love of the flesh's ease, and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and real unbelief that takes up in such hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisies, for their disrest. The Gospel disturbs them but in those ways of peace that will be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness in the latter end, and would not have them bring forth an <hi>abortive</hi> birth which after high expectation and <hi>some</hi> travel is a <hi>double</hi> wo.<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 10, 11, 12.</note>

                  <p>If men will presume that if they do not wrong their <hi>neighbour</hi> they are <hi>righteous</hi> persons, tho they make no conscience of repentance towards God, nor faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ; 'tis as reasonable for such men to expect peace with God,

Whereas if they walked in the light of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-precepts and promises, their <hi>little-case</hi> would be turned into those comforts, and that peace which passes all <hi>understanding,</hi> if not that joy which is <hi>unspeakable</hi> and full of glory.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Where the Gospel is sincerely embraced, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietness may arise from divers causes.</q>
                  <p>1. <hi>From the want of assurance of their sincerity, and Gods favour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saving faith, and the faith of <hi>assurance,</hi> are <hi>two</hi> things, as different as is <hi>true</hi> believing on Christ, and believing that we <hi>do</hi> believe. The first must needs be before the <hi>second,</hi> as the existence of a thing must be before we can know that it is. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a good soul lives in doubt of the latter all her days. But where there is the <hi>former,</hi> the concerns for eternity are <hi>secure;</hi> for <hi>the Lord knoweth who are his,</hi> tho they do not. But if they understood the Gospel and themselves, all their tormenting doubts would soon <hi>vanish.</hi> They have a proof of Gods love in their souls, and the light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101491:60"/> tells them so, but their eyes are so <hi>dim</hi> through ignorance, melancholly, fear, suspition, or Satans temptation, that they cannot <hi>see</hi> it. No wonder these good hearts are unquiet for the <hi>present,</hi> while to them, or in their apprehensions they are <hi>free a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the dead.</hi> But this is not the fault of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, but of their own ignorance of the truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> From <hi>the motions and prevalencies of remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corruptions.</hi> This is not only the cause of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual agitations in the soul, the spirit lusting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the flesh, and the flesh against the spirit; but besides that, all those motions of sin discover a sad source of sinful evil yet dwelling and abiding in us, and those motions and actuations of it are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reluctancies, but rebellions against the Law of God, and spirit of Grace. The events are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to sins advantage, and we are led captive by it for a season: <hi>What I would, that I do not; but what</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 15</note>
                     <hi>I hate, that do I.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if men shall be <hi>offended</hi> at the Gospel of Peace, and object against its <hi>title</hi> as incongruous, upon these or the former considerations; it is without all <hi>shadow</hi> of justice; for all its tendencies are to a righteous, real, satisfying, and durable peace; and will certainly procure it where it meets with a full and due compliance. But so far as we are defective therein, the banks are broken down, and sin and miseries break in upon us. And to a sanctified observing spirit, the effects, but much more the cause cannot but be grievous.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, If it shall be said that then what hath been spoken in the behalf of the Gospel of Peace, is all <hi>idle</hi> and to no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I answer first, That as the <hi>ultimate</hi> design of the Gospel is to bring us to that state wherein our peace shall be compleat; so notwithstanding all the troubles that arise in the <hi>mean</hi> time to a sincere <hi>upright</hi> soul, this feli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ity of everlasting rest will be the certain issue. And for our present <hi>militating</hi> state, there are in it (while we vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously press toward that mark) that kind and degree of peace which <hi>passes all understanding,</hi> with the <hi>present</hi> satisfaction that arises from the <hi>prospect</hi> and sense of that <hi>perfect</hi> peace, that Crown of Glory, Righteousness and Life, which we are <hi>nearer</hi> to, by every day that passes over our heads.</p>

                  <p>Certainly for <hi>such</hi> men, especially in the Pulpit, to vent Sedition, faction, hatred, wrath, enmity, instead of <hi>peace on earth, and good will toward men;</hi> say their lesson <hi>backward,</hi> and will sooner preach the Gospel <hi>out</hi> of the world, than <hi>into</hi> the hearts of men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4ly,</hi> Then <hi>God is the God of Peace.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures say it in so many words, but this Gospel of Peace proves it, If Gods <hi>say-so</hi> had needed a proof.

                     <hi>with him, and be at peace: i. e.</hi> Let the knowledg and sense of God awe thee into a better than a <hi>froward unquiet</hi> temper of spirit under his mighty hand; or, let the knowledg of the wisdom and goodness of God send thee to such constructions of his most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Providences, as may perswade thee to expect with patience a happy issue.</p>

                     <p>The comfort of knowing upon due inquiry that we are interested in the peace of the Gospel. The prudence of seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth in this matter, concerning our selves. The security and tendency to a change for the better, which is in knowing our not having the peace of the Gospel. Some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to such who embrace not the Gospel savingly. I shall handle all these briefly.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>First, <hi>The comfort of knowing our interest in the Peace of the Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every thing, whether good or evil, affects with joy or sorrow as it toucheth us, or is our concern. Relation to, or propriety in whatever, doubles and puts the accent and emphasis upon it. To know that this God, this Redeemer, and this Covenant and Gospel of Peace is ours is another kind of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of a higher relish unexpressibly more greateful and comfortable than the most accurate knowledg of all the excellencies that are in them abstracted from our relation to them, and interest in them. Therefore the wise Merchant when he had found the inestimable Pearl bought the field wherein those riches were, and sold all he had to make the<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 44</note>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:101491:63"/> purchase. And the wise woman <hi>considereth a field and</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 31. 16.</note>
                     <hi>she buyeth it;</hi> that is, that it might be <hi>her</hi> field.</p>
                  <p>It is a great unhappiness to know a good that is without our reach, or that we have not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what within our reach that can supply its room. This may be one construction of that truth, <hi>He that increaseth knowledg encreas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>th sorrow.</hi> But to have<note place="margin">Eccl. 1. 18.</note> it not only possible to be ours, but certainly so, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects with proportionable pleasure. This is the happiness of assurance which is more than meer saving faith without it; That we can rejoice in what we have in hand, and what we have in hope. We begin to reap in this life. We can draw water of life out of the Promises as out of our own Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern. As the great blessing of the Covenant of Grace lies in this relative particle <hi>my</hi> or <hi>thy,</hi> my Lord, and my God, I will be <hi>their</hi> God, <hi>their</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; So the great consolation is in the knowledg of our interest in him.</p>
                  <p>Wicked men, yea the <hi>Devils</hi> themselves may know as much of the being of God, and his infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and of the Grace of the Gospel, as a Saint, or an <hi>Angel;</hi> but this is so sar from contributing to their <hi>comfort,</hi> that 'tis the very flame of their trouble, they could rather wish they <hi>were not,</hi> and the cause is, that they know them as a felicity inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessible by <hi>them.</hi> Certainly no less comfortable is the knowledg of the Treasures of the Gospel as <hi>ours;</hi> this unites <hi>us</hi> to them, and communicates their comforts to us. To be particular in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of a well grounded assurance, would fill a Volume by its self. I shall add only, that all the good of the life that <hi>now is, and that which is to come,</hi> we can then put in ballance against the evils and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:101491:63"/> of this <hi>present</hi> life. This will not only <hi>overbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance</hi> them, but render them <hi>light</hi> afflictions indeed.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>2ly,</hi> supposing that upon examination we find not an answer of peace, but on the <hi>contrary,</hi> that in our <hi>present</hi> state we are in the gall of <hi>bitterness,</hi> and have no lot in <hi>this</hi> matter of the Peace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. Had we not better have saved our selves the trouble of <hi>searching,</hi> than to find an <hi>insupportable</hi> trouble, a sentence of death upon record against us, that we have nothing to do with peace?</p>
                  <p>I answer, That the case the thing in its self and really is but the same; 'tis not the true or false con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions that make any alteration therein, yet there is a mighty advantage in the knowledg of the Truth, though the Truth do not presently make us free from, but feel our misery which before we had no sense of. For,</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>It is a happiness to be undecieved.</hi> And it must be so, if it be an evil to be deluded and <hi>cheated.</hi> I have read of a Prince whose General being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated in a battel: The General sent him news of a great <hi>victory,</hi> which was the cause of three days <hi>rejoycing</hi> in Court and City. But the <hi>truth</hi> being soon brought to light, and the General returned, he was demanded by his Prince how he durst put such a <hi>trick</hi> upon him. He answered that the three <hi>joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> days they had in the room of three <hi>melancholly</hi> ones, in case they had known the <hi>truth,</hi> might not only excuse him, but <hi>merit</hi> some thanks for his good policy. I leave you to judg what was his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for such a mockery. And what improvement to make of it to my present purpose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly,</hi> Considering that tho we are at <hi>present</hi> stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Peace of the Gospel, having no inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:101491:64"/> in the Covenane of promise, yet this sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is not unalterable, 'tis not incurable, <hi>'tis a most necessary and good step to a well-grounded peace.</hi> A conviction of our present misery is exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable. I cannot blame those Physicians and friends that bury the truth in <hi>silence,</hi> when the Patients condition is hopeless. But to conceal a <hi>mortal</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease that's <hi>curable,</hi> to save a little present ease or satisfaction to the Patient, would be a cruel trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. <hi>The whole need not the Physician</hi> (saith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) <hi>but the sick. i. e.</hi> 'tis a dangerous thing to think our selves <hi>whole</hi> when we are not; for then we supposing no need of the Physician, will not go to him, and will slight him if he <hi>come to us.</hi> That man that is arrived at a conviction of his present evil state; and a due <hi>sense</hi> of it, and a knowledg of the <hi>remedy,</hi> is gotten a great way toward a <hi>happy</hi> change. The <hi>Jews</hi> that slew the Lord of Life were pricked at the <hi>heart</hi> by their convictions, but that <hi>stab</hi> at heart was a <hi>happy</hi> one, a <hi>healing</hi> one for them; for, it led them to the Lord of Life, to whom ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any came for life in good earnest, and went away without it.</p>
                  <p>A second Exhortation well grounded on this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that the Gospel is a Gospel of Peace, is, <hi>That you would not deceive your selves by seeking peace where it is not to be found,</hi> nor in any method but what the Gospel proposes. There 'tis to be found, and the<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 68.</note> way to it, and <hi>no where</hi> else. We seek the living among the dead if we go to the creature, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or to God himself without Jesus Christ. <hi>To whom should we go,</hi> (said <hi>Peter) Thou hast the words of eternal life.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly;</hi> Bless God that you are yet under the sound and tenders of the Gospel of Peace. The <hi>fallen</hi> Angels, so much more <hi>excellent</hi> by Nature than you, never had such Grace <hi>appeared</hi> to them. Those Men and Women who are gone to their <hi>place, dying</hi> in their Sins, shall never have its ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>again:</hi> this <hi>last</hi> might have been your <hi>present</hi> case; the only Grace of God hath made the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; acknowledg it by blessing, and glorifying <hi>him</hi> for such an unspeakable Gift.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly;</hi> Embrace the Gospel of Peace, that you may injoy the Peace of the Gospel: Embrace its Promises, its Precepts, its Doctrines and Counsels: Embrace its Mediator in the acknowledgment of all his Offices, of Priest, Prophet, and King; in the chearful submission of your selves to him, to his Merit, and Intercession; of your Faith to his Doctrine and Teaching; of your whole Practice to his Law and Government. I have shewed in this Tract, in many Particulars, what are its Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and its Comforts, to which I shall refer you for Motives to this Duty; only I shall add two more in this place.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You can never have a well-grounded Peace till then. <hi>There is no Peace to the wicked, saith my</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 57. 1.</note>
                     <hi>God.</hi> And all that embrace not the Gospel tendred to them, are wicked in <hi>his</hi> sight, tho not <hi>flagitiously</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 16.</note> wicked among Men. The righteous and the wicked divide all Mankind; under one of these distinctions we must be found, in the great day of Discriminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for <hi>Life or Death</hi> to all Eternity. If no due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to God and the Redeemer: If quenching the holy and gracious Motions of the Spirit of God: If despising the Riches of Divine Goodness: If
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101491:65"/> Enmity to sincere Evangelical Holiness: If the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Ingratitude to divine Love, Bounty, and Pity: If a wilful hard-hearted living to Sin and Vanity, and being altogether dead while we <hi>live,</hi> to that God and his righteous Ends, who gave us our Being out of <hi>nothing,</hi> be to be <hi>wicked;</hi> every Man and Woman rejecting the Gospel of Christ, are wicked with a witness. God hath said, there is no Peace to such; none but delusions and dreams of Peace; 'tis not all the Advantages thou canst promise Peace to thy self from, will be able to afford it, no not for the present.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Peace of the Gospel <hi>will cost you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is next to nothing, or worse than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What are all the Treasures, Honours, Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Pleasures of the World, but <hi>next</hi> to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? A great part of the World (saith one) is but a Crumb which God casteth to a Dog. <hi>Wilt thou set thine Eyes on that which is not?</hi> (saith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>) who had Time, Experience, and Wisdom above all <hi>mere</hi> Men, to make a true Judgment of <hi>this</hi> World, and all the Contentments that can be extracted from it; Vanity of Vanities is the brand put upon it by him, and by the common Consent of all <hi>considering</hi> Mankind.</p>
                  <p>As for the Corruptions of our <hi>Natures,</hi> our foolish and <hi>hurtful Lusts,</hi> our Ignorance, Error, hardness of Heart, alienation from God, Indisposition to all Evangelical Goodness, our Deserts or Demerits, which are all the Evils of Affliction we are capable of <hi>here,</hi> and hereafter: If these are not worse than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I know not what is.

This Rule conformed to, would dispose the whole World into an amicable and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Converse and deportment, in matters both <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and civil;</hi> We should see <hi>Halcyon</hi> days. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho <hi>other</hi> Men, Men not much pretending to a <hi>Gospel-Spirit,</hi> are not likely to <hi>inslave themselves</hi> (as they
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:101491:67"/> deem it) to this blessed Rule, which hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Suffrage of the Light of <hi>Nature,</hi> yet shining thorough the Darkness of all its Corruptions; thy <hi>apparent</hi> conformity to it in <hi>all</hi> thy ways would much win upon them (tho but for shame of the World) to carry it equitably and peaceably towards thee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Gospel obliges to a most benign, kind and beneficial carriage to all Men; both in word, deed and countenance.</hi> By all these to express good will to all Men. <hi>Do good to all, but especially to the Houshold of Faith.</hi> Let the Stream of thy kindness be most abounding to them that fear God; but not so restrained by that <hi>larger</hi> Channel, as not to reach in <hi>some</hi> degree the very <hi>worst</hi> of Men. The Gospel Rules give no <hi>countenance</hi> to a morose, tetrical, humoursom, and froward Behaviour, to a <hi>mere</hi> sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish, close-fisted, unmerciful Temper. It obliges to all that is <hi>worthily</hi> obliging, not only to <hi>Grace,</hi> but also to <hi>Nature:</hi> to <hi>whatsoever things are true; whatsoever things are</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Phil. 4. 8. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note>
                     <hi>venerable; whatsoever things are just; whatsoever things are pure; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever things are lovely; whatsoever things are of good report: If there be any Vertue; if there be any Praise,</hi> to <hi>think of these things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How great encouragement is given to benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in these Words; <hi>Trust in the Lord, and do good, so shalt thou dwell in the Land, and verily thou shalt be fed.</hi> Add to thy Faith Vertue, and thou shalt have <hi>Provision</hi> from God, and <hi>Quiet</hi> with Men.</p>
                  <p>I must not omit so remarkable a Passage as, <hi>for scarcely for a righteous Man will one die, yet perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture for a good Man some would even dare to die.</hi> This <hi>Goodness</hi> will not only bind <hi>bad</hi> Men to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101491:67"/> their <hi>good</hi> Behaviour, but oblige <hi>some</hi> to suffer <hi>for</hi> thee, rather than <hi>thou</hi> shouldst suffer. If Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, bare <hi>severe</hi> Righteousness fail of obliging Men to be peaceable toward thee, Goodness and <hi>Benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> may eke it out to a <hi>sufficiency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Not to render evil for evil.</hi> Doing wrong is a breach of Justice; But a returning of wrong for wrong, is a breach of the Peace. 'Tis an Injury returned that makes the War. That Passage is worthy the Divine Goodness and Wisdom of the Lord Jesus: Ye have heard that it hath been said;<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 38. 39.</note>
                     <hi>An Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth,</hi> (Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion Law right or wrong) <hi>but I say unto you, that ye resist not Evil:</hi> This is not the way to <hi>quench</hi> the Coals of Injury, but rather by suffering Evil <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently: If one smite thee on the one Cheek, turn the other to him also.</hi> Let Men be weary of doing thee Injury, before they shall be able to provoke thee to pay them in their <hi>own</hi> Coin, or do any thing in a way of revenge. The Jews held it lawful to <hi>revenge</hi> Injuries; and many of the Heathen Philosophers in their Morals maintained it, not only to be <hi>lawful</hi> but <hi>glorious:</hi> But what the Jews accounted <hi>innocent,</hi> and the Heathen a Vertue; that the Gospel-Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains as a Vice.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, To carry our Climax a step higher; the Gospel obliges to <hi>render good for evil. See that none render evil for evil unto any Man, but ever fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 15.</note>
                     <hi>that which is good, both among your selves, and to all Men.</hi> That of our Saviour is unparallell'd; <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour, and hate thy Enemy: But I say unto you, Bless them that curse you; do good to them that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:101491:68"/> hate you; and pray for them that persecute you, and despitefully use you.</hi> How did this kind of deportment melt the Heart of that envious and enraged <hi>Saul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to not only desisting from his <hi>Pursuit</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> that upright and useful Servant of his; but turned his <hi>Wrath</hi> into <hi>Repentance;</hi> his <hi>obdurate</hi> Heart into <hi>Tears;</hi> and his <hi>false</hi> accusation into a <hi>Confession,</hi> that <hi>David</hi> was much his <hi>better. Thou</hi> (saith he) <hi>art more righteous than I; whereas I rewarded thee evil, thou hast rewarded me good this day.</hi> If such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment as this will not quench the Evil; 'tis such an one as is kindled from <hi>Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>The Gospel ranks Ʋnthankfulness, not only among the distastful, but the damnable Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</hi> Such as a Man of any goodness toward God or Men, will not be guilty of. <hi>Ʋnthankful, Ʋnholy</hi> is its order of speaking. And sure as Unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is the most ungrateful Vice in the Eyes of God and Men, Thankfulness must needs be the most grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and obliging.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, It recommends to us <hi>a publick Spirit for the Church and all Mankind.</hi> If we have the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of this upon us, we shall be apparently the <hi>Blessings</hi> of Mankind, a publick and <hi>common</hi> Good. And if the Outcry against us be, as it was of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive</hi> Christians, that we are a <hi>publick Pest,</hi> a Plague to the World; this publick-spiritedness will be our Compurgator, and give our Accusers the Lye, as it did theirs; and in time render us as truly <hi>lovely,</hi> as<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 13.</note> before we were <hi>undeservedly</hi> hated.</p>
                  <p>And what is this publick Spirit, but to mind the<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 17.</note> common and <hi>universal</hi> Interest, and not <hi>narrow</hi> it to my Self, or my Family, or my Party? To be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and choose to suffer in my own Person or Estate,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:101491:68"/> that many may be the better for it. To be a <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and so much the more a Man as I am <hi>more</hi> a Christian than another. This is a Morality which the Gospel highly commends in the Apostles, and the Old Testament in <hi>Moses,</hi> &amp;c. But the Blessed Son of God, whose Pattern the Gospel commends to us, as we value the worthy Name of Christian, excelled all in <hi>this Point;</hi> who <hi>gave his Life a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som for many,</hi> and became <hi>Man,</hi> that he might by his Sufferings deliver us from Wrath to come, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile us to God, with whom are <hi>all our Concerns.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eighthly, It advises us <hi>to mind our proper work, and not to intermeddle with the matters that belong not to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The contrary to this is one of the greatest <hi>Make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baits</hi> in the World. Where this is practised, many a Rock of <hi>Offence,</hi> and provocation to Wrath is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</hi> Every Man to keep his <hi>Place,</hi> is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way for every Man to keep his <hi>Peace.</hi> In order to this the Scriptures commend it as our Duty and Wisdom, from the highest to the lowest. <hi>David,</hi> though a great Prince, did not think he had no <hi>bounds</hi> to his Province: <hi>Lord</hi> (said he) <hi>My Heart</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 131. 1.</note>
                     <hi>is not haughty, nor mine Eyes lofty; neither do I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise my self in great matters, or in things too high for me:</hi> He did not attempt beside his standing, nor above his understanding.</p>
                  <p>The Truth is, that as Disorder disturbs the March or Motions of an Army, <hi>embroils</hi> a Man's business, <hi>consumes</hi> his Estate, Body, and Soul: so whoever is the Author of it, is look't on as an <hi>ill</hi> Man; and a busie Body is not only a Cause, but the very Evil it self. Therefore the Apostle exhorts the Christians not to be <hi>busie-bodies</hi> in other Mens mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:101491:69"/>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Prudentials the Gospel furnishes us with, or allows to preserve our Peace.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I do not reckon the avoiding <hi>downright</hi> Sin, or that which is such <hi>per se;</hi> nor the necessary <hi>indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable</hi> Duties themselves, which the Gospel obliges us to, among the <hi>Prudentials</hi> of a Christian, or within the verge of its determination. Whatever appears to be <hi>such,</hi> must without farther considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be embraced, or rejected <hi>accordingly.</hi> If there be no avoiding of <hi>suffering,</hi> but at the price of <hi>Sin</hi> on either hand; he makes a fool's bargain, who purchases his Peace at so <hi>dear</hi> a rate. Prudentials ought not to determine on any consideration <hi>whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi> whether we shall transgress a <hi>negative</hi> Precept at <hi>any</hi> time: for that obliges <hi>ad semper.</hi> Though there be <hi>a time for all things;</hi> what is against a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi> Precept is to be <hi>excepted;</hi> the Precept that forbids Murder, Uncleanness, Lying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> forbids
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101491:69"/> it at <hi>all times.</hi> Neither doth Prudence reach the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the question of <hi>dispositive</hi> Duties, or <hi>Habits</hi> of Grace; whether we shall love God and fear him, or have a purpose and <hi>disposedness</hi> to obey all his positive or affirmative Precepts, <hi>when,</hi> and in <hi>what manner</hi> they become our Duties. Nor has it to do in matters of <hi>affirmative</hi> Commands, when a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> necessity, or what is equivalent, is a restraint upon us: For 'tis a ridiculous thing to put it to the determination of Prudence, Whether he that is blind, ought to <hi>read</hi> the Scriptures? or he that is deaf, <hi>hear</hi> the Word preached? or he that is a <hi>Prisoner,</hi> to go to the Christian Assemblies <hi>abroad?</hi> or he that has not <hi>any</hi> thing to dispose of, should communicate Relief to others?</p>
                  <p>The question that Prudence is concerned to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in a time of danger, is; What we may do to avoid suffering, without violating the <hi>Rights</hi> of God or Man? If there be any room for the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the Serpent, 'tis to defend us from the suffering, and yet<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 16.</note> maintain the <hi>Innocency</hi> of the Dove.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>The Gospel teaches, and gives a liberty to choose a lesser Evil (all things considered) for the preventing or avoiding a greater.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we must take this Rule, as concerning the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of <hi>Affliction,</hi> not of <hi>Sin.</hi> If a lesser Sin, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively with a greater, stand in competition; both are <hi>absolutely</hi> to be rejected. We must not compound one Sin for another, to do any <hi>sinful</hi> Evil that Good may come thereby, Good either <hi>simply</hi> such, or Good comparatively, <hi>i. e.</hi> a <hi>lesser</hi> Evil, is so far from our <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> and maintaining <hi>Purity,</hi> that 'tis a <hi>Flood-gate</hi> to Impiety, and such a blank brand as Christianity abhors. <hi>And not rather as we be slanderously repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101491:70"/> and as some affirm that we say, Let us do evil, that Good may come thereby: Whose Damnation is just.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we may admit, and <hi>chuse</hi> a lesser Evil of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, to avoid a <hi>greater</hi> of the same kind. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teaches to expose an <hi>Arm</hi> to a blow, to save the <hi>Head;</hi> to take Medicines, suffer Incisions, Cauterisings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to save our Lives, or preserve, or recover health. We are exhorted by Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, when persecuted in <hi>one</hi> City, to fly into <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 23. 24. 16. Act. 27. 11.</note> and rather suffer a voluntary <hi>Banishment,</hi> than to abide the Oven's Mouth of an unmerciful, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, tempting Adversary. We may preserve the liberty and safety of our Persons at the charge of our Purses. The Scriptures are so pregnant with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and Examples of <hi>this</hi> Nature, that 'tis need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to give more particulars.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>We may</hi> totally <hi>shift and avoid a suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, by withdrawing out of its way, when 'tis threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by some suddain transient motion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus did our Lord himself, whose <hi>Pattern</hi> is an Authority equivalent to a divine Precept or <hi>Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Then took they up Stones to cast at him: but</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 8. 59.</note>
                     <hi>Jesus hid himself, and went out of the Temple, going through the midst of them, and passed by.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is fit to be observed, that this withdrawing was in the very <hi>Act</hi> of his preaching to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and from the <hi>Temple</hi> it self, the most <hi>solemn,</hi> and the <hi>only</hi> consecrated place of God's Worship. God doth not require us to regard our Safety so <hi>little,</hi> as for a bare Circumstance, to stand <hi>obstinately</hi> in the way of a mad Bull, or unreasonable inraged Men, who are <hi>worse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:101491:70"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, We may, and ought to order the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of Time, Place, Number, and the like, (which are alway left to human Prudence) in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Actions, and Duties, as may most conduce to Safety, and free us from Disturbances from Men, and our own Fears; I say, the <hi>Circumstances,</hi> not omit the Duties themselves altogether, or so far as to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the Salvation, or necessary Edification of our Souls. This is the due Construction of <hi>Affirmative</hi> Precepts, that they bind not at all times, <hi>i. e.</hi> not to be practised always; (for otherwise we must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways praying, hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and confound all Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by performing them at the same instant of Time, which is neither a Duty, nor a Possibility;) but most to Edification.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We may be silent as to the open <hi>publick</hi> Profession of some Truths, at some times, wherein it will be made a Snare. We must not at any time deny the <hi>least</hi> Truth; to do so is <hi>utterly</hi> inexcusable, from the <hi>great</hi> Transgression, the <hi>presumptuous</hi> Sin. Suppose we were in Idolatrous Pagan, or Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Countries: If we take liberty to speak <hi>some</hi> Truths as freely as we may, and do, in <hi>Christian</hi> Countries; we must on no occasion visit such places, but at the cost of our Lives, unless we should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by <hi>Miracles.</hi> When the Reason is the same in <hi>other</hi> Places, the Duty or Liberty is the same also. No Man ought to accuse <hi>himself.</hi> And if Men will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse of professing necessary Truths with necessary Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, as guilty of a <hi>Capital</hi> Crime; we may say<note place="margin">John 18. 23.</note> as Christ, <hi>If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, We may make use of any <hi>good</hi> Principles, which our Adversaries, or any of them hold in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> with our <hi>selves,</hi> to conciliate their Friendship,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:101491:71"/> and engage them to our <hi>Security.</hi> I confess 'tis one Expression, and sad evidence of the <hi>Malice</hi> that prevails in the World, that a <hi>disagreement</hi> in some <hi>one</hi> Opinion shall raise more Hatred, Enmity, and Mischief, than the agreement in an hundred shall kindle Love and Kindness. There is much of the great <hi>Abaddon</hi> in this, of the Destroyer of Christians, by destroying their Love; that in order to Hatred and Miseries, an Opinion, a <hi>meer Opinion,</hi> or peaceable Practice, contrary to our Sentiments, shall weigh so much as to render a Man unworthy our Love, Peace, or to Live: And yet many a Moral, and Evangelical Truth which he holds as we do, shall not be thought worthy to <hi>touch</hi> the Ballance, nor speak one good word for him. I shall cite only one Text, to speak, or rather confirm the design of this Particular. <hi>But when</hi> Paul <hi>perceived that the one part were</hi> Sadduces,<note place="margin">Acts 23. 6, 7.</note>
                     <hi>and the other</hi> Pharisees; <hi>he cryed out in the open As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, Men and Brethren, I am a</hi> Pharisee, <hi>the Son of a</hi> Pharisee: <hi>of the Hope and Resurrection of the Dead am I called in question.</hi> The Issue was, the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who were in that point one with him, took his part; and the <hi>Sadduces</hi> lost their unjust and cruel Design against the Innocent Apostle. It is no part of the Duty, or Commendation of a Christian, to be so <hi>silly,</hi> as not to know and promote a <hi>just</hi> Interest, by honest and <hi>lawful</hi> means. He that puts on this Furniture of <hi>Christian</hi> Prudence, may prevent much of that Trouble which others expose themselves unto, and might avoid without <hi>Sin.</hi> It were well if we knew the difference of suffering the breach of our <hi>outward</hi> Peace for Imprudence, from that which is for <hi>pure</hi> Conscience: I am sure that upon a just <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,</hi> the former cannot find so good a Security for
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101491:71"/> its inward Peace as the latter; tho <hi>invincible</hi> Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the difference of the one from the other, may in <hi>some</hi> degree plead an <hi>excuse.</hi>

                  <p>If there be no avoiding Suffering without <hi>Sinning:</hi> If neither Piety nor Prudence can <hi>secure</hi> us, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile Men to us: Tho we cannot divert the <hi>Blow,</hi> we may ward it <hi>off,</hi> or be so well provided to <hi>bear</hi> its violence, that it shall not wound our <hi>better</hi> Part; its I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Conscience.</hi> Believe it, a Man's <hi>Conscience</hi> has more to do in the keeping or breaking a Man's <hi>Peace</hi> than all the World beside.

                  <p>His <hi>Sins</hi> are pardoned, and the <hi>Evidence</hi> of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled Divine Favour shines, in all the holy Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Principles that possess his <hi>Soul,</hi> and in the very <hi>Paths</hi> he walks in.

                     <hi>his Countenance beholds the upright,</hi> and then more <hi>especially,</hi> when they are discountenanced by Men for Righteousness sake.

                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The great Reward of Suffering for Christ's and Righteousness sake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A believing sense of this is enough to keep a Heart quiet under the most impetuous Storms of Affliction, and suppress not only our Groans, but the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Murmurs or Reluctancies: <hi>Blessed are they</hi>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:101491:74"/> derive sufficient Consolation from all those bright Stars of <hi>this</hi> kind that <hi>shine</hi> over his Head. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Believers are not made up all of Faith, and the little they have is very <hi>idle,</hi> when such Promises as these cannot keep them from breaking their Patience and Peace under a light Affliction. O for a Life of Faith! that's all that is wanting to <hi>confirm</hi> our Peace in the worst of Times, and put these words of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph first into our <hi>Hearts,</hi> and then into our <hi>Lips, I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live; And</hi>

                  <p>Fifthly, If all these Considerations prove not <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual</hi> by <hi>moral</hi> suasion, or as they carry in them the highest <hi>reason;</hi> to work a Christian walking in his Integrity into a quiet and calm Temper of Spirit: Yea, if all the Assistances of gracious Principles fall short of this end by their own Powers: There is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what I have yet to offer beyond them <hi>all;</hi> and that which all our Infirmities cannot baffle. And that is, <hi>God</hi> (according to his Promise) <hi>will undertake to work this Peace where the Mind is stayed on him.</hi> Tho it reach not the Triumph of the <hi>Assurance</hi> of Faith, or it is not strong enough to take fast hold of God's Strength and Truth, yet if it have but the Faith of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbency or Reliance; yea, but such a Faith as will keep it resolved from departing from God, he has ingaged to keep such a Soul in Peace, in <hi>perfect Peace.</hi> Thou <hi>wilt keep him in</hi> perfect <hi>Peace, whose Mind is</hi> stayed <hi>on thee, because he trusteth in thee.</hi> The <hi>God</hi>

                  <p>Now, let the worst come to the worst: If (in thy Christian Course) all those holy, harmless, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign, obliging Deportments towards the Adversaries of Evangelical Holiness, which the Gospel directs and assists thee in, cannot make their hard Hearts <hi>relent,</hi> their Bowels express some Pity toward thee: If all thy Christian Prudentials cannot put by the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed</hi> blow, but it lights and lies <hi>heavy</hi> on thee: Yet there is a reserve <hi>within</hi> thy self, or with thy <hi>God,</hi> that will secure thy <hi>Peace</hi> under all their <hi>Pressures. But we have this Treasure in Earthen Vessels, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Power may be of God, and not of us. We are troubled on every side, but not distressed; We are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed: Alway bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring about in our Body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the Life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our Body.</hi>

                     <p>The Gospel Furniture, for preserving a Man's Peace with himself.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I am not now to consider Peace in <hi>general,</hi> or as within our selves as the Subject and <hi>Seat</hi> of it, but Peace <hi>with</hi> our selves, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Peace between those Faculties and Powers of the Soul, which are each of them apart of our selves; and also of the <hi>same</hi> facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with it <hi>self.</hi> For not only the Judgment and Will, the Conscience and Affections may be at a jar one with <hi>another,</hi> but also the Judgment it self may not only hesitate, but militate with it self. <hi>I am in a straight betwixt two</hi> (saith the Apostle) first to determine which is best (all Circumstances conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:101491:75"/> secondly, and consequently, which to choose. This Contest and Counter-acting may be found in the Conscience, Will, and all the Affections upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers scores, not now intended to be handled: But there is that in the <hi>Gospel of Peace,</hi> which, though it do not, yea ought not to <hi>restrain</hi> all those Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that sometimes counter-ballance, and give check to one another, and in the same faculty, yet it provides so, as notwithstanding to preserve the peace and tranquillity of a Man with himself, so as those counter-Motions shall make no Disturbance or Disquiet to him.</p>
                  <p>What this Furniture is, is the next question to be resolved, and that which answers the Design of <hi>this</hi> Section.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>There is a sufficient clearness of Light in the Gospel, to determine and fix us aright in our main Concerns.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To be undetermined in our <hi>main</hi> Concerns (whatever prospect we have of other things) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses us to storms <hi>within</hi> from the Contentions of the greatest Competitors that can have to do with us, or we with them. When the Judgment, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, Will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall have the question agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by them in earnest; Whether God or the <hi>World,</hi> the Flesh or the Spirit, Time or <hi>Eternity</hi> shall have the ascendant in our Hearts and Lives? The Issues of these things, or of such like import, are so <hi>momentous</hi> and weighty, as it may well put a Man upon the <hi>wrack.</hi> But when these things are adjusted and fixed, all other things are comparatively indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. So that, though every thing is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, chosen, affected with a Christian Discretion, yet the Passions or Affections have no just provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:101491:75"/> to be stirred up to so <hi>high</hi> a Ferment, or our Impressions to be so deep and piercing, as to disturb our Peace.</p>
                  <p>A sufficient proof of this we have in the Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities that are in the World in the Concerns of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> beyond those which derive from diversities of Opinions in Philosophy, Medicine, or such Arts and Sciences as touch not Religion, or the Concerns of the Soul with God, and for Eternity. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is plain; because the one sort make no pretence to our <hi>main</hi> Concerns, which the other doth, as carrying our eternal Life or Death in <hi>their</hi> Hands. And though our Instance be of disquietness <hi>abroad,</hi> of Men one against <hi>another,</hi> yet all <hi>arises from those Lusts that war in our Members,</hi> and often act the same part among themselves. Having said thus much to clear our way, I shall say somewhat of the sufficiency of <hi>Evangelical</hi> Light, to help us to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and <hi>fix</hi> in our main Concerns.<note place="margin">Jam. 4. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two great things, yea the greatest of all other, the Gospel-Light <hi>sufficiently</hi> determines.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>That the knowledge and injoyment of, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to God is our chiefest and only satisfying Good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The knowledge of and conformity to God are es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to the enjoyment of him. The Evangelical Light of the Scriptures do so plainly discover these, that he that runs may read them, if he attend to it. I will instance in a few Texts; <hi>Acquaint thy self with</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 22. 31.</note>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:101491:76"/> seems, that Sin and Lust had not yet so far blotted out the Truth of Man's Happiness, consisting in the <hi>injoyment of God;</hi> but that some <hi>notions</hi> and <hi>sense</hi> of it did abide in so bad a Man as <hi>Cain,</hi> or at least was restored by the Gospel, as it was revealed in those<note place="margin">Exod. 33. 18.</note>

                  <p>What does the Gospel speak more <hi>clearly,</hi> than Reconciliation to God by Jesus Christ, Justification by his Blood, Sanctificatian by his Spirit unto Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and that Faith which embraces all these, and goes to God by Christ <hi>alone</hi> as the <hi>Mediator</hi> of the new Covenant? <hi>No Man comes to the Father</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, The Gospel excludes <hi>double-mindedness, and directs to the making God our sole ultimate End, and all other things subordinate to him.</hi>

                  <p>They who would have God, and the Happiness which is in his <hi>Favour,</hi> and yet are as much <hi>resolved</hi> to have the World, and gratify their <hi>Lusts</hi> too, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to themselves an inextricable Labyrinth of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions</hi> and Troubles.

                     <note place="margin">v. 22.</note> he had parted freely with the World, for the Embraces of Christ and Heaven, and rejoyced at so happy a lot.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Gospel discovers and commends to us all Goodness, Vertue, and necessary Truth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixture of Evil or Error.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All Goodness, Vertue and Truth are at peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves. There can be no Discord between one Truth and another, one Vertue and another.</p>
                  <p>So far as Truth and Goodness have the <hi>Dominion,</hi> there will be Peace: and so far as the Gospel is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood and <hi>embraced,</hi> they will be <hi>uppermost.</hi> It is not so with <hi>Error,</hi> Ignorance, <hi>Vice</hi> and Sin; They are at variance among <hi>themselves:</hi> One Error con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>another,</hi> one Lust contrary to <hi>another:</hi> And he who serves <hi>them,</hi> and follows their Conduct with greatest <hi>fervor,</hi> is like to be the most <hi>unhappy</hi> Man,

                  <p>Two <hi>Titles</hi> are ascribed to Christ and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; <hi>Melchisedec King of Salem. Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec</hi>

                  <p>'Tis said, <hi>Col. 1. 13. Who hath delivered us from the Power of Darkness, and hath translated us into</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 1. 13.</note>
                     <hi>the Kingdom of his dear Son. The Power</hi> of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is, either the Devil, or those <hi>Lusts</hi> by which he prevails, or rather both: 'Tis called a <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> that to which we are translated, a <hi>Kingdom:</hi> The one being a meer unrighteous <hi>Force,</hi> that which can plead no Right, or <hi>Authority from God,</hi> or pure Nature. 'Tis a perfect mischievous Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, full of Error, Confusion, Contradiction and Fear: They who are Slaves to this Tyranny, must needs be alway quarrelling with <hi>themselves:</hi> But a <hi>Kingdom</hi> (and a Kingdom of <hi>the dear Son of God</hi> especially) is a State of Law, Righteousness, Order, Common-good and Tranquillity, and therefore desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reable and <hi>peaceable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, So far as the Gospel of Peace is embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <hi>The Ʋnderstanding, Conscience and Will are agreed, and have a peaceful Harmony in the same Subject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:101491:78"/>
                  <p>They are all regulated by that <hi>Law,</hi> which most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually and infallibly answer to the righteous Ends of God, his own Glory, and the pure natural, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Ends of Man, his <hi>consummate</hi> Good: This is Peace, <hi>pure</hi> Peace.</p>
                  <p>All these Faculties are part of our selves; but where Truth prevails on the Judgement, Conviction moves the Conscience, and stubborn Opposition possesses the Will, how can that Man be at peace with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self? There is certainly the most domestick, intestine, unnatural War that can be imagined: The Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment directs the Conscience, the Conscience first commands the Will, and upon its Opposition, or <hi>Rebellion rather,</hi> it discharges all its Artillery against that and the Man <hi>himself,</hi> whose Will is thus obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Conscience flashes Hell into the Soul like so many Granadoes or Fireballs, breeds the <hi>knawing</hi> Worm there that never dies, till Conversion; or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science tired and fallen asleep, or so often <hi>ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>led</hi> as to desist from farther Attempts: But if it come to this <hi>last,</hi> the Condition of that Man is so much the more desperate, and next door to that of a Reprobate. Tell me then in sober sadness, if the Gospel under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, and embraced into the Possession of the whole Soul, is not a blessed Mean to that Peace with our <hi>selves,</hi> which, next to that with God, is our greatest Concern?</p>
                  <p>To apply it more particularly: 'Tis hard for them that converse with the Gospel (except Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism or desperate Hardness of Heart have gotten the ascendant) not to be convinced that there is a God, that God is the God of Peace, that Obedience to the Gospel is the high-way to Peace with God and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life: But if the Will and Affections maintain
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:101491:79"/> the <hi>contrary,</hi> and rebel against <hi>this Light,</hi> this Light turns to <hi>Fire</hi> in the <hi>Bosom,</hi> it wounds the Soul, and makes those Breaches as let out all its Peace, without which Life it self is not worth continuing. Thou knowest better things than thou dost love or <hi>live;</hi> every step thou takest Conscience meets thee with a sore Rebuke, and tells thee no Man goes this way and <hi>lives.</hi> Conscience neither fears nor spares thee.<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 18.</note> But when once thou bearest a <hi>respect,</hi> a <hi>sincere</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful respect to all the Evangelical Law; and thy Judgment, Conscience and Will are under its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; all of them conspire to a sweet Calm, a holy Serenity under the Shines of God's Countenance, and well-grounded Evidences of the Uprightness of thy Heart, and the Goodness of thy <hi>State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>The Gospel obliges us to a Resignation of our Judgments to the Divine Wisdom, and our Wills &amp; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to the Divine Will, revealed in the Scriptures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Light of <hi>Nature,</hi> corrupted by the <hi>Fall,</hi> was so far <hi>benighted,</hi> that <hi>the World by Wisdom knew not</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 21.</note>
                     <hi>God;</hi> but did as it were <hi>feel</hi> (or grope) <hi>after him,</hi> as Men without either Eyes or Light; what certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note place="margin">Acts 17. 27.</note> in matters Divine or Spiritual could be expected from it? How unfruitful, and consequently how <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceable</hi> would all our Agitations be, in quest of those Truths that most concerned us? Whereas now by the Light of the Gospel, we have the Umpirage of the Divine Wisdom and Veracity. All we have to consider, is duly to understand the <hi>true</hi> Sense of the <hi>written</hi> Word, which is the <hi>Oracles</hi> of God. There<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 99.</note> is sufficient in his <hi>ipse dixit</hi> to determine all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, solve all Difficulties, answer all Objections, fix the Mind upon that Rock of Truth, which is as firm and as stable as its Author.</p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:101491:79"/>
                  <p>And though the right Understanding of the Sense of <hi>some</hi> Texts of holy Writ hath been a Bone of so much Contention and <hi>Mischief</hi> in the Church; 'tis not to be imputed to the <hi>Obscurity</hi> of the Text in <hi>momentous</hi> Matters at least, such as are necessary to <hi>Salvation:</hi> But to the Pride and <hi>corrupt</hi> Interests that Men <hi>first</hi> espouse, and then cruciate the Scriptures to serve those Lusts, with the Sanction of a <hi>Divine</hi> Authority. When the Christian World shall become honest, humble, heavenly and peaceable; the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will not only be better <hi>practised,</hi> but also much more easily understood, and Men shall see <hi>eye to eye</hi> their true meaning.</p>
                  <p>If we consider the resignation of our Will's and Affections to the Divine Will; we shall find it <hi>equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> contributing to Peace with <hi>our selves,</hi> with that resignation of our Understandings and Opinions to the Divine <hi>Wisdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is indeed no Peace with our selves in any thing short of this Method, and this will reach it <hi>infallibly.</hi> Experience proves that Children left to<note place="margin">Prov. 22, 15.</note> their <hi>own Wills</hi> and Appetites, are of all others the most froward and troublesom to others, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves also. That <hi>Liberty</hi> of Will proves the greatest <hi>Bondage</hi> and Torment. Therefore Parents, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Childrens Good and Quiet, take it to be not only their Authority, but the genuine Fruit of <hi>Parental</hi> Love, to subdue their Childrens Wills to an <hi>absolute</hi> Subjection to their Command; 'till they have their own Reason grown up to some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency to govern themselves.</p>
                  <p>But when they are risen to a Freedom from paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Tutelage, is all then secure? is there no danger of brutish <hi>self-disturbing</hi> and self-destroying Passions?
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:101491:80"/> Far otherwise: Nothing more blind, heady, ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned<note place="margin">Job 11. 12.</note> than Man left to himself. But suppose that at mature Age he betake himself to a comporting with the Wills of <hi>others;</hi> this will but increase his <hi>Difficulty</hi> and Torment. If he pleases <hi>one,</hi> he shall displease <hi>others.</hi> One Man <hi>wills,</hi> another <hi>nills</hi> the same thing; and 'tis so with Men of <hi>equal</hi> repute for <hi>Wisdom.</hi> Ignorance, Conceit, Humour, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, Interest, inslave almost all Mankind, and biass them from the <hi>true</hi> and straight Measures of Truth and Goodness: So that a Man that has any Care of his <hi>own</hi> Concerns, had need put the question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>he</hi> or <hi>they</hi> to whose Advice or Authority he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits his <hi>Will,</hi> betray him not to some greater Evils than meer Inconveniences, from the taint of some one or <hi>more</hi> of the above-named Biasses? But if he do so, I am in a dream waking, if he increase not his Perplexities, and tempt himself to let loose the Reins of his Fancy, or sit down altogether unconcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the matters of God and his <hi>Soul,</hi> whatever he may do as to the Concerns of this World. But the Will, and Affections resigned to the Will and Conduct of God and the Redeemer, hath all the <hi>Security</hi> imaginable. There can be no Ignorance in Wisdom it self, nor Design to <hi>deceive</hi> in Truth and Faithfulness it self. God hath not, nor <hi>can</hi> have any <hi>Ends</hi> to serve upon us, for he needs nothing out of <hi>himself:</hi> Nor can there be any Addition to Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. All that God pretends to from us, is his own Glory: and to render him that is, not only most agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>pure</hi> Humanity, and becoming his Creature; but by the Divine <hi>Grace</hi> is made inseparable from our <hi>own</hi> Good. And as ill as the Behaviour of <hi>faln</hi> Man has been towards his God; the Gospel of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101491:80"/> Christ hath its whole Design and Tendency written in its Fore-head; <hi>Glory to God in the highest, Peace on Earth, good Will towards Men.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 14.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude, I will appeal to the Experiences of all that have trusted God, so far as to <hi>try</hi> him by this holy Resignation of their whole Soul to his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Will, if they have not found their Peace with <hi>themselves,</hi> thrive or <hi>languish</hi> according to their Sincerity in this Resignation.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>The Gospel above all things explodes desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Hypocrisy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The designed Hypocrite aims at deluding <hi>others,</hi> by Simulation and Dissimulation, <hi>i. e.</hi> by putting on an <hi>appearance</hi> of what he is <hi>not,</hi> and by hiding from others what he <hi>really</hi> is: Thus his Inside and <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side</hi> are at the highest jarr and disagreement. Now as the whole Masque of an Hypocrite is a mere piece of <hi>Art</hi> and Juggle, an Appearance that ariseth not from inward <hi>spontaneous</hi> Principles; 'tis matter of continual Pain and Care to maintain and carry on this <hi>Imagery:</hi> And if it be done so like the Truth and <hi>Life,</hi> that, as the Disciples of Christ, every one will suspect himself rather than this <hi>Judas;</hi> yet in the mean time his <hi>Heart</hi> reproaches him, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science that sees <hi>all,</hi> and is under no Temptation to Fear or Flattery, casts in his Teeth, that all his pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted laboured <hi>outside,</hi> is but Sham and <hi>Illusion.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side all this, he finds it a hard Task to carry on the Cheat <hi>long</hi> without discovery; and in the mean time his Guilt puts him in continual Fear, that he is detected, and that others suspect what he knows of himself to be <hi>too true.</hi> Thus the Hypocrite has no Peace <hi>in,</hi> no agreement <hi>with</hi> himself.</p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:101491:81"/>
                  <p>But a sincere, upright and free Soul, which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel so much commends, doth not pace it in <hi>Tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels,</hi> needs no Paint nor Peruque, may spare all those <hi>troublesom</hi> Artifices. Let but the <hi>renewed</hi> Nature, the Love and Fear of God, the living Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Grace that are <hi>within,</hi> have their free course; and the outward Countenance of the Conversation will <hi>naturally</hi> and easily be formed a Saint, a holy, blameless, lovely, divine thing. <hi>The King's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is all glorious within, and her Raiment is of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered</hi>

                  <p>But the Gospel hath provided better things for us: For though we are defective in our Duty, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to many Infirmities, ever and anon making false Steps, yet while our Eyes are single, our Aims sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere to please God in all things, God is pleased with us, our Peace is kept with him, <hi>His Countenance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds</hi>

                  <p>Secondly; In case of wilful, known Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the Psalmist calls the presumptuous Sin, the <hi>great</hi> Transgression, which indeed lays our Peace a <hi>bleeding;</hi> True <hi>Evangelical</hi> Repentance renewes the Soul to its Integrity in it <hi>self,</hi> and its Peace with <hi>God.

                     <hi>thy Sin.</hi> And that every true Penitent shall meet with the same relief; the Psalmist gives us his <hi>own</hi> experience, with what hope others ought to raise from thence. <hi>I acknowledged my Sin unto thee, and mine Iniquity have I not hid; I said I will confess</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 32. 5, 6.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>This was not the manner of the Law of Works: for there was <hi>no place</hi> for Repentance: Its <hi>Severity</hi> rendred the <hi>first</hi> Fault to be <hi>Death</hi> without <hi>Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>

                  <p>This blessed God-man is ascended and seated a Lieger and <hi>Stationary</hi> at the Right Hand of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for this very end; <hi>There he everliveth to make Intercession for us.</hi> Indeed the Gospel with all its <hi>Priviledges,</hi> leaves us in <hi>this</hi> World to a <hi>Necessity</hi> of such a Friend in the <hi>Court</hi> of Heaven: But such a faithful and <hi>effectual</hi> Friend he is, that an <hi>upright</hi> Soul may live at <hi>Hearts</hi> ease in this World, for all it needs fear of a breach with God. <hi>If any Man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ</hi>

                     <hi>the righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This blessed <hi>Advocate</hi> is concerned in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Office, principally for three things: First, to obtain <hi>assisting</hi> Grace, that we may not fall into Sin. Secondly, <hi>Restoring</hi> Grace, that we may be recovered out of the Snare of the Devil. Thirdly, <hi>Pardoning</hi> Grace, that we may have the same Smiles of God's Face, the same <hi>delightful</hi> Converse with him, and the same plentiful Communications from him.</p>
                  <p>All that has been said (though short, <hi>exceeding</hi> short of what is <hi>real</hi> Truth, <hi>revealed</hi> Truth in this matter) may be abundantly sufficient to <hi>confirm</hi> that great Gospel-truth. That <hi>there is sufficient Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

               <p>THE Improvement of the <hi>abovenamed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First;</hi> This Doctrine teaches us to understand two things: 1. <hi>Who they are, that are like to hold on in a Christian Course.</hi> Not all <hi>certainly</hi> that make a Profession of Christianity: Alas, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such are there that go to the War without their Armour, yea, that never entred the Lists of a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Combat, nor came within the reach of the <hi>Cross</hi> of Christ, nor ever yet <hi>intended</hi> it.</p>
               <p>But for those whom the Cross and other Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons assault, but they are either without any Armour at all, of God's appointment or preparing; what can be expected from them, but to be overtaken and prevailed on by the Temptation? and that is the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> the <hi>Snare</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>There are yet another sort of Persons, who neither eat, nor drink, nor sleep, nor move, nor live, without this <hi>Armour on:</hi> Their <hi>Feet shod with the Preparation of the Gospel of Peace.</hi> These are the Persons (if we could but know them) that are like to <hi>hold on their way;</hi> to whom the <hi>worst</hi> of Godliness will be no <hi>loss,</hi> but <hi>great Gain:</hi> Who may challenge and defie all Adversaries and Adversities in the Terms of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,

                  <hi>Shall Tribulation, or Distress, or Persecution, or Famine, or Nakedness, or Peril, or Sword?—Nay in all these things we are more than Conquerors through him that loved us.</hi> The same strain of a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well-grounded <hi>Triumph</hi> of Faith, reaches to the End of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then they are much mistaken, who take a Life of Godliness upon the Terms of following Jesus Christ, and living in the Ordinances and Truths of the Gospel at all seasons, to be an intolerable and unreasonable thing.</hi> Did Jesus Christ send his Servants as Beasts to the Shambles, run them on the Point of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations without a sufficient <hi>Security</hi> to their <hi>greatest</hi> Concerns; did he send them on a Warfare at their <hi>own</hi> Charges, and put them upon Impossibilities; did he propose to them those Rewards that were hopeless and desperate; there might be <hi>some</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for such sad and discouraging Censures of the holy Ways of Jesus Christ: But these Pretences are all out of doors. No Man was ever lost in God's Way, nor a Loser by it. The Ways of Wisdom <hi>are Pleasantness, and all her Paths are Peace.</hi>

               <p>None are of the above-nam'd bad Opinion, but such as know not God; such who are unacquainted with the Gospel, or have made no tryal of it in good <hi>earnest.</hi> If the <hi>Flesh</hi> were to undertake the Task of <hi>Religion,</hi> or a willing Mind left to its own <hi>feeble</hi> Powers, the best of us all would <hi>sink</hi> under its weight: But let us up and be doing what Christ <hi>commands,</hi> and have open Hands and Hearts to his Comforts and Reliefs; then we shall say and feel, that <hi>his Yoak is easy, and his Burden is light.</hi>

               <p>This Doctrine in the second place is of reproof, and First <hi>to those who esteem of the Profession of Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-holiness and Practice of it in others so far as it goes, to be but Hypocrisy; because they cannot find in their hearts to go to the charge of it themselves.</hi>

If a dead Man can taste and relish the best prepared <hi>Viands,</hi> or put on, and use to <hi>purpose</hi> the most approved Armour? Let your State be first changed, by being renewed in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of your Minds; become God's Workmanship in Christ Jesus; and then you will be <hi>created</hi> to all these good Works, and have Faculties and Powers disposed to do, suffer, and enjoy like a Christian.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:101491:84"/>
               <p>Secondly, It reproves those Professors of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, who <hi>are so far from Peace, that they shame the Gospel, as if its Furniture were not of Proof to obtain and maintain inward Peace.</hi> The holy Psalmist in one Instance of Defectiveness in this Peace, chides<note place="margin">Ps. 42. 5.</note> his own Soul▪ and gives it better advice; <hi>Why art thou cast down, O my Soul? why art thou disquieted within me?</hi> Hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him <hi>for the help of his Countenance.</hi> A cheerful exact Holiness is the great Glory of the Gospel; and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Evidence that 'tis the Gospel of <hi>Peace.</hi> We find when the Spies sent from the <hi>Israelitish</hi> Camp to search out the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they brought back a <hi>bad</hi> Report of the Land, and all from a <hi>base</hi> Fear; thereby they brought up a bad Report of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> of God, and the Character he had given of it as a Land flowing with Milk and Honey. They said<note place="margin">Numb. 13. 31, 32, 33.</note> it was a Land that <hi>eateth up its Inhabitants,</hi> instead of <hi>feeding</hi> them with Plenty and <hi>Dainties:</hi> A Land wherein were the <hi>Anakims, terrible</hi> Men: And it was not so easy a matter, as that going up and possessing it was all they had to do; they must fight for it, and fight against such, before whom they were no more able to <hi>stand,</hi> than a <hi>Grashopper</hi> before a Man. Little was God, his Word, or his People beholden to these Men.</p>
               <p>But there are another sort of Men whom this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine highly commends: And they are <hi>such as give credit and reputation to this Truth, by living like it:</hi> Such an one was <hi>Caleb; But my Servant Caleb had</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 14. 24.</note>
                  <hi>another Spirit with him:</hi> And what was that but a Spirit agreeing to the Promise of God? <hi>And Caleb still'd the People before Moses, and said, let us go up at once and possess it, for we are well able to overcome it:</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:101491:84"/> He tells them that those Giants were but <hi>Meat for them;</hi> he represents God like himself, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, such as became God, <hi>a very Truth.</hi> Such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the Apostle <hi>Paul, None of these things move</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 20. 24.</note>
                  <hi>me,</hi> &amp;c. His Mind was neither removed from his Duty, nor moved in its Peace and Tranquillity. One or two such Heroes live more <hi>Credit</hi> to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, than a thousand faint-hearted, unbelieving, flesh-pleasing Professors.</p>
               <p>The third Improvement shall be for exhortation; First, to the <hi>Ʋnregenerate;</hi> Secondly, to the <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the Unregenerate first, <hi>Do not think it will be to your Loss, to embrace the Gospel in all the Laws of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do not let the pains-taking, the Adversaries, the Adversities that attend Gospel-integrity, discourage you. It hath Provision for your Peace, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>all these.</hi> If you cannot have a Freedom <hi>from</hi> Trouble, you may have Peace <hi>in</hi> Trouble, and this is better, and your Peace <hi>greater: Nay in all</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note>
                  <hi>these things we are more than Conquerors.</hi> Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors overcome their Enemies, and disable them from <hi>afflicting;</hi> but the truly Evangelical Soul over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes by suffering, and overcomes the Suffering it <hi>self</hi> by Faith and Patience. O begin to trust God in good earnest: Let not the Pleasures of the Flesh tempt you to make God a Liar any longer: Do not sooth up your selves in a <hi>false</hi> Opinion that you <hi>trust</hi> in God, till you dare to <hi>try</hi> him, by resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving effectually to live <hi>godly in Christ Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Bewail your Sin and Folly in seeking Peace where God hath said, and all Mens experience has proved that there is none.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:101491:85"/>
               <p>O what Folly and Perverseness is this! to hope against Hope, to persist in an Opinion against the <hi>Ʋniform Contradictions</hi> of all Men, in all Ages: And yet not to seek Peace, where never any sought it <hi>duly,</hi> but first or last they <hi>have</hi> or <hi>shall</hi> find it.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine exhorts those who are <hi>regenerate,</hi> and have <hi>sincerely</hi> embraced the Gospel of Peace, first, <hi>to live like the Gospel of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let your Lives be a due Representation of the Gospel, as that whose Furniture is sufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve your Souls in Peace against all Encounters in your <hi>Christian</hi> Course. Do not tempt others to <hi>believe</hi> there is no such <hi>Vertue</hi> in the <hi>due</hi> Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Gospel by your <hi>unquiet</hi> Spirits under <hi>Afflictions,</hi> and too often without any Temptation but your <hi>unquiet Hearts.</hi> That Physician and his Medicines are not likely to have many Admirers, whose Patients appear little or nothing the better, except a verbal Commendation of his Skill, and the Excellency of his Remedies. 'Tis a great shame and Scandal that those Professors of the Gospel cast upon it, that have their Peace no better <hi>secured</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Assaults, than <hi>theirs</hi> who make none or but small pretensions to any serious Acquaintance with the Gospel, or any such high Opinion of it.</p>
               <p>I have had much ado to forbear downright chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding some high Professors, who upon a cross Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the Concerns of this World, loss of dear Relations, Reflections upon their Reputations, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers in their Bodies, Apprehensions of Trouble in and for the Ways of Truth and Godliness, shew as great or greater Distempers and Passions, than those who know no other Supports than mere <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Fortitude. What do these more than others?
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:101491:85"/> What do these but reduce the Profession of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to that <hi>low Ebb,</hi> which Stoicism was charged with, that for all its great Looks made no difference between its Disciples and others, but only this, that they could talk more gloriously?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Do not go out of God's Way to provide for your Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you are not secure <hi>there,</hi> you can be secure no where: Be ashamed to trust to your own Prudence, rather than to God's Promise, who will lay out Heaven and Earth and all his infinite Perfections, rather than be worse than his Word. If you run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from your God and leave his Tents, you must leave your Armour behind you, and expose your selves naked to your Adversaries Weapons. God hath promised to keep thy Peace <hi>in</hi> his ways, but not out of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>While you are in God's Ways, put on and keep on</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 11:</note>
                  <hi>his Armour;</hi> live continually in the <hi>due</hi> use of it. 'Tis not having it in your Bibles or Heads, but in your Hearts that will bless you with its Peace: It is Spiritual Armour: In your Spirits it must have its Magazine, on your Spirits it must be worn, and sit as near you as your Skin to your Back, and as the Quality adheres to its <hi>Subject.</hi> By your Spirits assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by God's it must be managed for this <hi>great</hi> Service.</p>
               <p>The third Doctrine I gave you from the Text, was, that in order to preserving our Peace by the Armour of God, we must put it on; and also eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Piece of Armour in its right place, according to the Text therefore; <hi>Let your Feet be shod with the Preparation of the Gospel of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:101491:86"/>
               <p>I shall add only four Directions how this Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I have so largely insisted on, may be useful to you, and conclude this Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, Faith must be kept up in its strength.</hi> Tho it be a principal Part of the Christian's Armour by it self, yet 'tis a large share in all the rest; yea, all the rest will lie by dead and useless, but as invigorated by Faith. And indeed 'tis therefore called the <hi>Shield,</hi> which covers and is applicable to all the Parts of the Body, from Head to <hi>Foot.</hi> Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our said to the blind Men, <hi>Be it to you according to you Faith</hi> imperatively: I may say indicatively eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">Mat. 9. 28.</note> Part of your Spiritual Armour will prove as the Faith is whereby you use it. The Promises and Doctrines of the Scripture, though intitled truely from God, can have no more Power with us, than Faith, which is the <hi>Gift</hi> of God too, gives to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Let the Word of God dwell richly in you in all Wisdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The more rich you are in the indwelling Word of God (I mean of that written Word of God) the more plentiful your Preparations; but without Wisdom to understand, and apply it aright: The Devil will be more able to <hi>wound</hi> you, yea to wound you with your <hi>own</hi> Weapons, than you will be able to defend your <hi>selves.</hi> The Wisdom of the Lord Jesus confounded the Devil and the <hi>Sadduces</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and discouragement from farther At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, by his ready and wise application of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Our own Hearts have not only a strange Perverseness against Duty, but sometimes against our due Comforts also: and I have known not only Men, but <hi>Women</hi> strangely witty to prevent the cure
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:101491:86"/> of their wounded Spirits. Impertinent Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Scripture seldom prevail where the <hi>Soul refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to be comforted,</hi> or the Arrows of Affliction and sad Apprehensions sink deep.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Be careful and watchful:</hi> Let not your Adversary take you napping, or, which is as bad, in a <hi>sensless Indifferency.</hi> Let not the Devil <hi>out do</hi> you in these two so necessary Qualities. While Men slept, the Eenemies sowed the Tares. He watches Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to break; do you be as watchful to keep or or to recover your Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly, Joyn Prayer to, and with all your Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>

               <p>It is God who puts Spirit and Life into our <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> Armature, and into us too, that we may know, and be able to <hi>use</hi> it. He is the <hi>God of the Spirits of all Flesh.</hi> Your Armour, as I shewed in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Text, is the <hi>Power of God;</hi> that Power which God sends as Auxiliaries to us in our Spiritual Warfare, and that Power which God is pleased to joyn himself <hi>unto,</hi> and thereby renders it like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Almighty and invincible in its <hi>Place,</hi> and to its <hi>designed</hi> Ends. Prayer takes hold on God, and adds his Influence to <hi>your</hi> Graces, and to <hi>his</hi> Word: And what cannot the Word of God, the Grace of God,<note place="margin">Ep. 6. 18.</note> and the God of <hi>both</hi> do, when all are united to the same end: With the Words of the Apostle to the same purpose, I therefore conclude, <hi>Praying always with all Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all Perseverance.</hi>

                  <p>THese Words will not give us any <hi>Exercise</hi> in looking into the Context, for the better understanding their <hi>genuine</hi> Sense: For, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nature of Proverbs, they are a short sentence, including much solid and pithy matter in a few words.</p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:101491:88"/>
                  <p>We have in the Text a double Preference; first, of the <hi>slow to Anger</hi> before the <hi>Mighty:</hi> 2dly, of him <hi>that ruleth his Spirit,</hi> above him <hi>that taketh a City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Comparison lies not in things of the same kind, and the Determination to which the <hi>majus aut minus,</hi> the greater or lesser degree of that ought to be given: but of things of a <hi>divers</hi> kind, which of them has in it the greater <hi>Goodness.</hi> In short, not who is the <hi>greater,</hi> but who of these is the <hi>better</hi> Man.</p>
                  <p>The particular Qualifications instanced in, are two on <hi>each</hi> part: and they both are expressive of Power and <hi>Dominion;</hi> but they greatly differ in their <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> and the <hi>Orbs</hi> wherein they act. The Mighty, the Mighty, whose Power hath for its Object things <hi>without</hi> himself; the Mighty to such a <hi>Degree</hi> that a City (wherein the Power and Policy of many sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Persons are met and <hi>united,</hi> a City walled and <hi>munited,</hi> and thereby better able to resist Assaults, than a Multitude of Men in the open Field) is made a Captive by it, cannot withstand its Force: This looks great.</p>
                  <p>The Qualifications on the other part are Might and Power <hi>too;</hi> but as its Object is more secret and invisible, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of a Man, his <hi>own</hi> Spirit, and its Exercise principally upon the Theatre <hi>within,</hi> a Man's <hi>own</hi> Bosom; it looks not so big as the <hi>other,</hi> it may be is not <hi>observed,</hi> it may be so far as obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the foolish <hi>sensual</hi> World, is not <hi>approved,</hi> but scorned as an abject, <hi>pusillanimous</hi> thing. But whatever the common Cry of brutal Men may be; the <hi>Divine</hi> Wisdom that judges not according to these <hi>Appearances</hi> that take with <hi>Ʋs,</hi> but judges
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:101491:88"/>
                     <hi>righteous</hi> Judgment: He gives the <hi>Garland</hi> to the latter; He is the better Man of the <hi>two.</hi> And this is to be understood <hi>indifferently</hi> of high or low, rich or poor: He that is <hi>slow</hi> to Anger, he that ruleth his <hi>Spirit</hi> is a <hi>better</hi> Man, than he (let him in other respects be what he will) that hath this for his <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal</hi> Commendation, that he is a great <hi>Conqueror,</hi> a Mighty Man in <hi>outward</hi> carnal Force and Power, and that <hi>successful</hi> also.</p>
                  <p>I shall yet further consider the Man in his <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications</hi> that the Text gives the Preference to; that by <hi>mistaking,</hi> I may not set the Crown on the <hi>wrong</hi> Head, or leave the thing in <hi>question</hi> as dubious as I found it.</p>
                  <p>His first Qualification is a slowness to Anger. <hi>He that is slow to Anger.</hi> It is not said, He that is <hi>never angry,</hi> or that hath wholly <hi>suppressed</hi> that Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or <hi>Affection:</hi> for, that were (whatever the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks boast) a <hi>maim</hi> to <hi>pure</hi> Nature. We may be angry and not <hi>sin,</hi> or that Text, <hi>Be angry and sin</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ep. 4. 26.</note>
                     <hi>not,</hi> is unintelligible; yea, we may sin in <hi>not</hi> being angry: For, so did <hi>David</hi> in his remission of it to his Son <hi>Adonijah;</hi> And good old <hi>Eli,</hi> for not ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>more Fire</hi> in his Rebukes to his <hi>prophane</hi> Sons, who by their Wickedness caused the Offerings of the Lord to be <hi>abhorred.</hi> Yea, God is said to be <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,</hi> and Jesus Christ was <hi>really</hi> so, neither of which could sin, or would lay on themselves an <hi>Imputation</hi> of it in a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> sense.</p>
                  <p>Again; I must consider this <hi>slowness</hi> to anger, as not deriving from a dull, sheepish, flegmatick, <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Temper, or rather <hi>Distemper:</hi> for, a Man <hi>so</hi> qualified, hath no more of Grace or Vertue in <hi>that</hi> regard, than may be found in some mere <hi>Animals:</hi>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:101491:89"/> And the Spirit of <hi>Grace</hi> or Human <hi>Reason</hi> hath no Concern in it at all, no more than is in the <hi>stayedness</hi> of a <hi>Log.</hi> It is not by Election, but by necessity of Nature or Habit. Though there may be a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Goodness</hi> in a Sheep or Dove, we cannot allow that the <hi>Patience</hi> of the one, or the <hi>Meekness</hi> of the other is either a <hi>Grace</hi> or a <hi>Vertue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The due Consideration of the Text will set it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Controversy, that the <hi>Goodness</hi> of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to whom the Preference is given, <hi>derives</hi> from a Rule or Government of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and therefore is not a meer <hi>Disposition</hi> how good soever, which we very properly have learned to call a <hi>good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</hi> And this particular Instance of a <hi>Slowness</hi> to Anger doth fall under that Goodness of our <hi>ruling</hi> or governing our Spirits, for which the Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Text is <hi>wholly</hi> designed.</p>
                  <p>We must now consider the later good Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Text; <hi>And he that ruleth his Spirit:</hi> Here is Agency and Object, that which ruleth, and that which is ruled; both included in the <hi>same</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the same <hi>individual</hi> Man, a certain Oeconomy, or Ministration of Government in the <hi>Microcosm</hi> the little World of Man.</p>
                  <p>Our first Inquiry will be (as it ought to be) what <hi>Part</hi> of Man it is that carries the Title of the Person <hi>He,</hi> and bears the Regency? and what that <hi>Spirit</hi> is, that is, or ought to be in subjection to it?</p>
                  <p>Where the Mind or inward Man is distributed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>superior</hi> and inferior Parts; we usually under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by the <hi>Soul</hi> the inferior, and by the <hi>Spirit</hi> the superiour Parts of it: But here is an Inversion of <hi>that</hi> Order, or we must allow this Title of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:101491:89"/> of Man, to those Parts of the Mind or inward Man that are in the Order of Nature the <hi>subjected</hi> and inferior. This the holy Scripture sticks not at in more places than <hi>one.</hi> In the Words I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding, it must be understood of the <hi>inferiour</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul; and I shall give two other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Instances of the same sense, and that will be <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;</hi> for we are not now enquiring of the <hi>Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety</hi> or Boundaries of Words and Terms, but what is the true meaning and sense of the Text: The Words are▪ <hi>Do you think the Scripture saith in vain,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 4. 5.</note>
                     <hi>the Spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to Envy?</hi> The Spirit is said here to <hi>lust,</hi> which must needs be an Act, Disposition, or Motion of the Will or Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I shall add that of our Saviour, whereby he rebuked his Disciples; <hi>Ye know not what manner of</hi>

                     <hi>Spirit ye are of; i. e.</hi> what manner of Jealousie of, and Zeal for my Honour that is which ye pretend to; 'tis not so <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>regular</hi> as ye imagine.</p>
                  <p>This Province being thus far discharged, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains necessary to add, is easy, and obvious; <hi>scil.</hi> That the superiour Faculties of the Soul are the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or governing Parts, the Inferiour <hi>subjected</hi> to them. By the <hi>Inferiour</hi> we understand the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; these ought to attend to the Dictates of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, by which is to be understood the Judgment, or Understanding, which determines of <hi>true or false,</hi> good or <hi>evil;</hi> and the Conscience which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes the Application to the Will and Affections, to will or <hi>nill,</hi> to love or <hi>hate, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here will arise another Question not inferiour in its weight to any of the former, <hi>viz.</hi> That seeing these superiour Faculties in Man, to which God hath given the Superintendency over the Inferiour, are so
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:101491:90"/> weak, blind, wild, brib'd and biassed a thousand ways, and too often prostituted to the Service of the most vile Lusts and Passions. This Ruler stands in as great need of being ruled and corrected, as those Faculties, the Will and Affections, which of them selves are perfectly <hi>blind:</hi> Who is the <hi>Ruler,</hi> and what the <hi>Rule</hi> of its Government, a Submission and Obedience to which will justly reach the <hi>Goodness</hi> commended in the Text?</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. II.</head>
                  <p>I do not forget, nor am insensible of the maze of Difficulties and Contradictions, the Agitation of this Question hath been <hi>incumbred</hi> with. I shall therefore content my self <hi>here</hi> with four Propositions, which will go a great way toward the determining this Question.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That God himself as he is the Original and Author, and (by consequence) the most right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and <hi>absolute Owner,</hi> so he is the Supreme and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign</hi> Governour and Law-giver to all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>This is asserted by the Apostle, and most appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 36. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> consonant to the Light of <hi>Nature; For of him, and through him, and to him are are all things, to whom be Glory for ever, Amen. All Power</hi> (or<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 1.</note> Authority) <hi>is of God;</hi> whether <hi>Natural,</hi> or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical, or Ecclesiastical, it derives from <hi>Him:</hi> And whatever <hi>other</hi> Sanctions of Laws and Commands there may be to oblige a practical and <hi>external</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; there is no Sanction that touches the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> but the respect of their Derivation from the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:101491:90"/>
                     <hi>Divine</hi> Authority: Therefore the same Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts Christians to a more noble, rational and <hi>assured</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 4, 5.</note> Obedience to their Governours, than could arise from meer politick or selfish regards: <hi>For, he is the Minister of God to thee for good:—Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for Wrath, but for Conscience sake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Government we are now concerned to understand being <hi>natural,</hi> hath of all other the most immediate Derivation from God, and the <hi>least</hi> disputable. Parental or Paternal Government is natural, and therefore till the Sight of those great Spring-heads, such as Patriarchs, or more <hi>General</hi> Fathers was lost by the distance of the <hi>Streams,</hi> or Confusion of Posterities by other accidental or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent occasions; the Parental Government was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, most extensive and indisputable.</p>
                  <p>But of all natural Government, as that of and <hi>within</hi> each rational Individual is most <hi>intire,</hi> so it is most intimate and near; and of all other the <hi>first</hi> derived from God; it being <hi>concreated</hi> with the first Man, and continued distinct from all others in every Individual. And although the fitness and disposedness of the Judgment or Understanding and Conscience in each rational Creature as created, may sufficiently determine them for that Office of <hi>Rule</hi> in a Mans self, as designed and appointed thereunto by the all-wise Creatour; we are not left without a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Revelation of this <hi>Divine</hi> Disposition.</p>
                  <p>'Tis said of <hi>Saul,</hi> that <hi>he forced himself.</hi> This is<note place="margin">1 Sam. 13. 12.</note> easily understood by the Context, to be meant of his violating his <hi>own</hi> Conscience, sinning against the light, dictates, and sanctions of it, breaking thorow all to gratify his own impatient Passions. This the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:101491:91"/>
                     <hi>Samuel</hi> calls in the next Verse, the not keeping <hi>the Commandment of God:</hi> It was a violating his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> reduces all Duties wherein any Man is religiously concerned, or with respect to Divine Authority to this secret Court of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as to God's acceptance and his own Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>And herein do I exercise my self to have a</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science<note place="margin">Acts 24. 16.</note>
                     <hi>void of Offence towards God and towards Men.</hi> This may suffice to prove that God hath placed these superiour Faculties, not only with a disposedness to direct the Will and rule the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and all the inferiour Man, but hath invested them with his Authority.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Rule</hi> by which the superiour Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Judgment, or Understanding, and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are to be directed, is <hi>Right Reason, and the Word of God supernaturally revealed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I say <hi>Right</hi> Reason: For as there is <hi>Science fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so called,</hi> and <hi>vain Philosophy,</hi> because, either<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 20.</note> consisting of Chimerical and arbitrary Dogma's, or of no use to the benefit or <hi>bettering</hi> of Mankind; so many things pass for <hi>Reason,</hi> and obtain that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation both in private and publick, that are meer Fallacies.</p>
                  <p>And indeed if we consider the <hi>Shipwrack</hi> of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or of the Light of <hi>pure</hi> Nature, that is the doleful and apparent Consequence of the <hi>Fall:</hi> we ought to be concerned to examine every thing with the greater Diligence, that imposes it self under the pretence of that <hi>venerable</hi> Authority: Lest we receive base Mettal to our loss, under the <hi>counterfeit</hi> Stamp and Image of <hi>Cesar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It hath been the wise and gracious Work of God in favour of Mankind, so maim'd and impotent in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101491:91"/> this <hi>Guide</hi> of his Life, to superinduce a <hi>new</hi> Edition of Light and Truth for our direction in <hi>Morals,</hi> derived immediately from the Divine Will and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and contained in his <hi>written</hi> Word. To this it becomes us to take heed, as to a Light that shineth in a dark place, and to <hi>revere</hi> it to that degree, as readily and thankfully to receive it to conduct, and correct our Understandings and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and over-rule their Dictates, wherein they <hi>dissent</hi> from it.</p>
                  <p>But that Part of the <hi>written</hi> Word which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>Evangelical,</hi> and which the Light of Nature (how pure and clear soever) could have no prospect of, without the Assistance of <hi>supernatural Divine</hi> Revelation, hath, or ought to have, so absolute and independent Dominion over our Understandings and Consciences, that all the Exercise of our Reason <hi>thereabout</hi> is only to take in the due sense and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of those Expressions, by which the Divine Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and Wills is <hi>communicated</hi> to us.</p>
                  <p>In short, our Understandings, as they (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Light of Nature) apprehend, and we accordingly acknowledge the Divine Understanding to be <hi>infallible,</hi> and the Divine Will <hi>inculpable;</hi> that which derives most purely from God (which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally is his written Word, or the Sense contained therein) is to be so far the Light and Rule of our Understanding, that nothing is to be admitted as true, or good in Contradiction to what it affirms or denies to be such.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That he who with an upright honest Mind, applies himself effectually to▪ the Conduct and Government of his Affections by his Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and Conscience; guided by this right Reason,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:101491:92"/> assisted by the Light of God's Word: He I say is the Man that so rules his Spirit, as (according to my Text) he <hi>is a better Man than he that taketh a City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant, that an honest <hi>well-meaning</hi> Person, who proposes to himself a <hi>Government</hi> of his Spirit by these Rules and Helps, may in <hi>many</hi> things miscarry and tread awry. Mis-understandings of the <hi>Rule,</hi> Mis-applications of it arising from the Ignorance of our <hi>selves,</hi> and sometimes in the best of Men, the Violence and <hi>Ʋnruliness</hi> of some Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions or Affections, <hi>abetted</hi> by various occasions, will render our Conformity to the Rule, many Degrees below <hi>Perfection:</hi> yet a Mind applying it self to <hi>practical</hi> Understanding, will not only be <hi>positively</hi> good, but compared with that which is <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded,</hi> and let loose to blind and impetuous Passions, will be eximiously and <hi>excellingly</hi> good. It will ordinarily keep within some <hi>Compass</hi> that hath a Decorum and <hi>Beauty</hi> in it. <hi>If thine Eye be single,</hi>

                     <hi>thy whole Body shall be full of Light.</hi> Honesty and Simplicity in the <hi>Aim</hi> will scatter many of those Clouds, and much of that <hi>benighting</hi> Darkness, which corrupt and base Ends <hi>embroil</hi> the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing withal. And indeed, though natural and acquired Parts in Conjunction with an <hi>upright</hi> Heart, will <hi>ordinarily</hi> much outdo <hi>Honesty,</hi> not so atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: yet, with the Helps afforded by Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to those who live in our Age and Place, that Scripture will be <hi>experimentally</hi> confirmed; <hi>And an High-way shall be there, and a Way, and it</hi>

                  <p>This brutal feral Power subservient to Ends more vile than it self, may render Men greater, but 'tis the Government of a Man's own Spirit that renders him <hi>better</hi> than others: That by its appearances may carry the Opinion of <hi>Fools,</hi> this as real and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial, obtains the Preference with God and all <hi>wise</hi> Men.</p>
                  <p>It is this Government of the <hi>Spirit</hi> wherein <hi>the Righteous is more excellent than his Neighbour.</hi> The
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:101491:93"/> holy Scriptures give us no Encomiums, no Elogies of Praise in the Memorials of great Conquerors, for that <hi>mere</hi> Consideration, but often the contrary: But the Volume of that sacred Testimony is every where furnished with the Commendations of those Men, who were so much Men and <hi>Saints,</hi> as by the Grace of God, governed their own Spirits, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the old Man with its Affections and Lusts, lived by Rule, ordered their Conversations aright.</p>

                  <p>In order to this Excellency the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepared himself against the Tyranny of Custom or Superstition in indifferent things. <hi>All things are lawful, but I will not be brought under the Power of</hi>

                     <hi>any; i. e.</hi> neither my Passions, nor those of others shall <hi>usurp</hi> Authority over my Understanding or my Liberty to act accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Above all other Examples to this End, those of our blessed Redeemer excelled in the <hi>steady</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own Spirit; he was in all things <hi>purely</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 15.</note>
                     <hi>natural</hi> of the same Make with the rest of Mankind; he had the same <hi>Affections,</hi> was equally exposed to Hunger, Thirst, Pain, Weariness; his Temptations exceeded those of any other: Yet under all he so go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned his Spirit, that nothing of <hi>Disorder</hi> was to be found in it. His Affections moved not, but at the Command of a sanctified Will, guided by a clear and <hi>pure</hi> Understanding: He had nothing of that Corruption within <hi>him,</hi> that in us ecchoes to the Call of Temptations from <hi>without; when he was reviled, he reviled not again:</hi> The Agitations of his Soul was like that of the most pure Water, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining its <hi>Clearness,</hi> (though shaken) and nothing sullied with those Dregs which lodg in us, and are so easily stirred and mix themselves with our best Motions.</p>
                  <p>The highest Instance of the Rule of his Spirit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in that Scene which some of his Detracters
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:101491:94"/> have dared to charge with the <hi>manifest</hi> Tokens of Weakness and Pusillanimity. <hi>My Soul</hi> (saith he) <hi>is exceeding sorrowful even unto Death.—O my</hi>

                     <hi>Father, if it be possible, let this Cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Saviour in these Passages most abundantly expresses the just and <hi>due</hi> Measures by which his Passions moved. He permitted those <hi>deep</hi> Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that Prospect he had of his dying Sufferings, as they were Penal, (not for his <hi>own</hi> Faults, for he was most perfectly <hi>innocent,</hi> but) as in them he bare the Punishment of <hi>our</hi> Sins in his own Body and Soul. In all of this Nature he was <hi>voluntarily</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying therein with his <hi>Love</hi> to faln Man, and that Obedience and Duty wherein he was by his own Consent obliged to his Father. And though his Fortitude was <hi>infinitely</hi> beyond any Man's, by which he could have faced the severest and most <hi>terrifying</hi> Objects, without the least change of Countenance or depression of his Spirits: yet he did not so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he <hi>ought</hi> not; his Duty as Mediator (and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under that peculiar Law) was to suffer, and to <hi>chuse</hi> Suffering. He was sent and came into the World to that very End, which never was the case of any Man but of <hi>him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas his <hi>ardent</hi> Prayer, that if <hi>possible</hi> that Cup might pass from him, hath been by some Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries of Christianity reflected on as a kind of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentence</hi> of his great Undertaking; There is nothing in it but what answered the Conduct of the most <hi>deep</hi> Wisdom, and the answer of the most <hi>stayed</hi> and well-govern'd Affections.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit and Grace of God which dwelt in our Lord Jesus without <hi>measure,</hi> did not destroy or <hi>abate</hi>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:101491:94"/> in him any thing of that which was <hi>purely</hi> natural. Death, as a dissolution of those Bands of Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Soul and the Body, was a proper and <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> object of Fear: But as his Death was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Pain and Sufferings to such a degree, as answered to what was <hi>due</hi> to them whom he <hi>redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> it was to be feared to a degree <hi>proportionable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as this Fear was a part of his Suffering (which was so necessary to his Body and Soul, being made a Sacrifice and Offering for Sin,) so it was but the Motion of pure Nature, of pure natural Affection; which to be <hi>without</hi> is reckoned by the Spirit of <hi>God,</hi> to be not only a Sin in it <hi>self,</hi> but also a cause of<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 3.</note> those that should render the last Days so <hi>perilous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But herein shined especially the Government our blessed Redeemer had of his own Spirit, that he could give to <hi>pure</hi> natural Fear <hi>such</hi> a Scope as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him; and yet make so <hi>full</hi> and perfect a stop, when its farther Advance would have usurped on the Soveraignty of the Divine Law; of that Divine Law which obliges by both the Light of Nature, and that of Evangelical Grace, to sacrifice some <hi>natural</hi> Rights to his Glory and the Good of our Brethren; trusting to the Divine Benignity to make a full Compensation some <hi>other</hi> way.</p>
                  <p>And by so much the more, as his pure <hi>natural</hi> Fear, Aversation and Abhorrence of so great a Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was risen in his Soul; so much the more noble and <hi>conspicuous</hi> was the <hi>Government</hi> of his Passions, in their not so much as <hi>relucting</hi> against the Divine Will, abstracting perfectly from such an Evil; yea from the Consideration of the Divine Will, that so he must suffer; they, even those Affections assist in forwarding his Sufferings; and a greater Zeal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:101491:95"/> for suffering than ever was of a Fear and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of it. The Roman Heroes did not with so great a Resolution cast themselves into the gaping Chasm, as he into this manifold Hell of Misery. He seemed <hi>afraid</hi> lest his Adversaries should by mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take <hi>miss</hi> their Prey, or his Friends should feel one Spark of that Fire, which he was designed to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and quench in his <hi>own</hi> Bosom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whom seek ye?</hi> (says he to these who sought his Blood) <hi>I am he.

                  <p>The Goodness of governing our own Spirits, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that of Power over the Persons and Concerns of other Men.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>The governing a Man's own Spirit hath in it much more of Generosity and true Greatness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What Greatness of Spirit is in those Men, who are so feeble as to be hurried on by vicious Passions; obstinately bent to have their Wills how blind and unreasonable soever in <hi>themselves,</hi> and mischievous and destructive to others? What mighty Vertue or
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101491:95"/> worthy of Praise, to thirst after the Applause of Greatness, and a remembrance to Posterity as an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe, by a mad <hi>hair-braind</hi> World, who have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally had so poor a Spirit as to flatter <hi>Greatness</hi> for fear its Weight should otherwise crush them. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>mere</hi> Power subduing others, without any Consideration of Right, Justice, or any Vertue (for 'tis such a Power and Domination we speak of) is the most feeble and slavish in it self, and the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to Mankind.</p>
                  <p>I can hardly believe that any Man who has a sense of that great after-reckoning, which all Men must make with the most high and holy God; would not rather choose in that dreadful Day to stand before God an humble, meek, self-denying mortified Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever (tho the most obscure Person in the World) who hath endeavoured to live according to a divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inlightned and sanctified Reason, than an <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> or a <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> a <hi>Dyonisius,</hi> or any that have been the very Image of the great <hi>Abaddon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But he that governs his own Spirit is truly great and <hi>generous:</hi> His Conflicts are the most <hi>just</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the most <hi>difficult.</hi> It is no great matter for a Man to ride over <hi>other</hi> Mens Bellies whom he <hi>hates,</hi> as cross to his Ambition and <hi>Self-will:</hi> but to turn our Weapons into our <hi>own</hi> Bosoms, and stab those Lusts that have been dearer to us than our very <hi>Souls;</hi> those Lusts that were bred and born in us, from the Service of which we have drawn all our sensual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and those sweet Dreams of Felicity wherein we have blessed our selves, and have had our <hi>grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Sentiments, accompanied with the Consent and Applauses of the <hi>Generality</hi> of Mankind; and those in vogue for wise sagacious Persons: This is great
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:101491:96"/> indeed; especially considering that the Strugles of these inordinate Affections are so strong, continuate,<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 8, 9.</note> and near to us, that every blow we reach them, we feel the Smart of, at least so long as their Interest is great in us, as if it were a wounding our selves, and a Dagger piercing our own Bowels. I will add, what renders it most <hi>generous, viz.</hi> that this bridling our Affections, and mortifying their corrupt and extravagant Motions, is to reduce our selves to a right and sanctified Reason to serve the Will and Interests of God and his Glory, which is the most becoming an intelligent Being that is <hi>his</hi> Creature, as 'tis the only <hi>genuine</hi> Gratitude to, and Acknowledgment of his Creator, and the only <hi>wise</hi> Method for obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Holiness and Happiness which are inseparable.</p>
                  <p>A governing and bridling a Man's <hi>own</hi> Spirit, from far <hi>less generous</hi> Principles, was deemed by the better sort of Heathens more <hi>great</hi> and glorious than their <hi>other</hi> Victories. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried<note place="margin">Quin. Curt. in Vitâ.</note> more in his abstinence from <hi>beholding</hi> the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatious Beauties of the Captive Persian Women, than in subduing to his <hi>Will</hi> the Persons and Possessions of their Princes. <hi>Agesilaus</hi> a King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Kisses of a beautiful Boy, and being by some Lookers-on wondred at, and in some kind <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plut. in Vitâ.</note> as too morose, replied, that he would give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way one half of his Kingdom to be able to resist such another Temptation.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>self</hi>-Government is that Greatness and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity that renders a Man so free, as 'tis not in the Power of bad Men, nor the evil Angels neither to <hi>enslave</hi> him. This Notion was the <hi>Philosopher's</hi> Glory; but the Christian's is so much <hi>more</hi> glorious, that the Glory of mere <hi>Philosophers</hi> is no Glory by
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:101491:96"/> reason of that Christian Glory which so far <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth</hi> it. A singular Instance of this Christian Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness we have in the Apostle <hi>Paul: None of these things move me:</hi> I stand as a Rock against all their Billows: The strong Winds and Storms that beat on<note place="margin">Acts 24. 20.</note> my <hi>outward</hi> Concerns, do not so reach my <hi>inward</hi> Man as to make any Commotion <hi>there,</hi> much less so as to remove me through a base Fear of suffering from my Duty.</p>
                  <p>Another Expression of the same Gospel Hero is, <hi>God forbid that I should glory save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus, by whom the World is crucified unto</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 14.</note>
                     <hi>me, and I unto the World.</hi> He accounted nothing more great and generous, than to be as much above, or out of the reach of the World's Temptations, as a dead Man: Nor any thing conducing to this Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <hi>so much</hi> as the Cross of Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Knowledg of a crucified Redeemer. So that in fine, this Government of our own Spirits is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>better</hi> than that <hi>other</hi> Might and Dominion to which it is opposed; but, 'tis also more <hi>mighty,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomes <hi>greater</hi> Difficulties, and its very Power as <hi>Moral,</hi> much more as <hi>Christian,</hi> has a Goodness in it equal to its Power; yea the very Power is Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the <hi>Principle,</hi> and its Exercise is Goodness in the Practice.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The ruling of our own Spirits is our Duty, and a Compliance with that which is the true and only Measure of Goodness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Man <hi>beside</hi> his Duty, is so far vain and waste; a Man <hi>opposite</hi> to his Duty, is so far vile, polluted a Sinner, a crooked deformed thing. <hi>This only have</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Ruling our own Spirits by Christ's Rule, hath the most excellent Principles, and the highest Ends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There may be a ruling our Spirits, which is but a <hi>Mis-rule,</hi> bending them from one Crookedness
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:101491:98"/> to another: But where the Rule of Christ is the Rule by, and <hi>to</hi> which we endeavour to manage our Spirits: This governing hath Principles and Ends that have no Parallel for Goodness and <hi>true</hi> Greatness.</p>
                  <p>For its Principles, shall I give you that <hi>first</hi> which <hi>is</hi> first (in order of being) of all Christian Vertues or Graces, <hi>Evangelical sanctifying Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That</hi> Faith, by which we have a Prospect of <hi>those</hi> Motives, that are of greater weight in the Ballance, than the All of this lower World. That Faith by<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> which we adhere to God's Will, trusting on God's <hi>Word;</hi> who can as soon die as lie, cease to be God as cease to be <hi>true,</hi> and can as easily perform his<note place="margin">Ep. 2. 12.</note> Promises as speak them: That Faith by which we enter into the Covenant of Grace. and become (I dare not say Confederates with God, but) <hi>Foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rati,</hi> or Parties to that Covenant, wherein God hath <hi>graciously</hi> become bounden to us. That Faith by which we become <hi>so united</hi> to Christ, as to be his <hi>Members;</hi> Members of a Divine <hi>Head,</hi> and Head of <hi>Influence,</hi> from whom Faith derives a Power,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 19.</note> greater and better than ever subsisted in any more Man without it. I will only add one Quality more of this Principle; <hi>viz.</hi> that it sanctifies the Heart; which is to say, it <hi>purifies</hi> our Affections, as well as impowers us in the pursuing their Objects.</p>
                  <p>A second Principle is <hi>Love,</hi> a holy, a Divine Love, a Divine Love, as it hath principally a Divine <hi>Object,</hi> and a Divine Original and <hi>Author,</hi> and in a way su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural derived to us. 'Tis the Love that is the Chariot of the Government of a Christian's Spirit; the <hi>Vehicle</hi> of its Motions. <hi>A Chariot the midst</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Can. 3. 10.</note>
                     <hi>thereof being paved with Love.</hi> What more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:101491:99"/> than Love? What more sweetning to doing or suffering? What more regular in its designs and Tendencies than a <hi>holy</hi> Love?</p>
                  <p>A third Principle (which is not the meanest) is a Principle of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> an inherent prevailing Disposition to give to every one their due, and to God in the first place. This Principle is that which we commonly call <hi>Honesty.</hi> And indeed that Rule that is <hi>governing,</hi> that is on the bottom of pure impartial Honesty, must needs <hi>excel.</hi> The Apostle gives us three Qualifications of what he commends<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8.</note> to us; <hi>True, honest, just;</hi> And they seem all to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend much the same thing. When once a Man comes to this Point, that he will not, he dares not do or be otherwise than becomes him, than is his Duty; <hi>He loves Righteousness, and hates Iniquity:</hi> That<note place="margin">Psal. 45. 7.</note> Man's ordering and managing his Spirit must be lovely, truly comely and excellent. I might add the Principle of <hi>Gratitude,</hi> the most generous of all, and most abounding in a real Christian, who, in all his ways is designed to acknowledg God; such a due Object of highest Gratitude from all Men, that he that lives in the Neglect of it, is an ungrateful Wretch; let him complement his Fellow-sinners at what rate he will.</p>
                  <p>The Ends of governing our Spirits according to Christian Principles are more excellent, being especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally five, which I shall but name.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To reduce it to, and maintain it in its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To live more happily: This Rectitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as conducible to it, as Health is to bodily Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. To serve our Generation, which is next to be preferred after our selves, and sometimes before our selves.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>It hath for its End a preparedness for Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Grace of God in us, though it be nothing meritorious of the State of the Blessed; yet it is that which renders us <hi>meet to be Partakers of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>I know not how Men of any <hi>Discretion</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial</hi> Inquiry into their own Hearts, can satisfy themselves of the Sincerity of their Disposition to this Obedience, who do not watch, and pray, and work to some degree of <hi>Industry</hi> for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; And, as the Apostle speaks, <hi>keep under their Bodies,</hi> i. e. use all means to bring their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into order; lest after all their presumptions of their Security for another World, they should prove <hi>Cast-aways.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>They rule their Spirits, that they may in this World be to the Honour and Glory of God and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These are none of the Principles from which, nor Ends <hi>for</hi> which Men ordinarily greaten and lift up themselves in the World by Force and Might: They are commonly Principles and Ends of quite another Nature, have nothing to do with things of so worthy a Character; self, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:101491:100"/> self, is their Spring, and their Aims rise no higher.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Advantage of governing our own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits above Power to subdue others, is, That <hi>to the overcoming and subduing others, many Hands are necessary beside our own, and thereby the Action and its Success is common to many: Whereas the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our own Spirits is our own peculiar Act.</hi> And although the Honour of every <hi>good</hi> Act espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially is to God, as performed by his Grace; yet an Act which is peculiarly ours (which a Conquest over our selves is) doth give us a much greater share of the Character of Goodness, than what is depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on thousands for the help of Heads, Hearts and Hands.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>The Capacity of governing our own Spirits ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us capable of a Law, and the Ends of it, which is obtained by governing our Spirits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether we consider a Law as the Law of God or <hi>Man</hi> (if a Law indeed) we are obliged to render Obedience to it. All Laws are supposed to have to do with <hi>rational</hi> Creatures, and the Scripture sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, and affirms also, should be obeyed for <hi>Conscience</hi> sake; that is, not only an external <hi>politick</hi> Obedience is to be given them, but an internal and conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Obedience.</p>
                  <p>Divines and Philosophers agree, that <hi>mere Animals,</hi> on the consideration of their being without <hi>Reason,</hi> cannot be guilty of Sin or moral Polution, because they are not capable of a Law: Certainly this pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them at a great distance below <hi>rational</hi> Creatures. To bring this home to our purpose; Doth not that highly contribute to our Goodness, that so far ranks us above Beasts? And indeed though a Man be a
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:101491:100"/> Man as to his <hi>essential</hi> Considerations, who is a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaker, a lawless Person, with whom a Law has no regard, and, <hi>as such,</hi> no effect; yet as being a Man, and yet so bad a Man, he becomes more vile than a Beast; as he that neglects and destroys the Ends of Reason, which is so great an Excellency, is more vile than that which never had such a trust, but acts suitably to its natural Principles tho of a lower kind.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>We are able to resist Temptation, no farther than we have the Government of our own Spirits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Temptation, whether from Men, or from the wicked one, is no Temptation to <hi>us,</hi> any farther than it finds or begets an Inclination to <hi>compliance</hi> with it. 'Tis this Inclination therefore that is to be disposed and ordered according to Duty: But he that doth not govern and rule his Affections, is like the Chaff driven to and fro with the Wind.

But was this a sufficient Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the <hi>Prevalence</hi> of Temptation? No such matter; it was the compleat Government of his own Spirit, not only in the Habit and Power, but in the Act and Exercise also that was his Security. Tho some add the Impossibility of his Defection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Hypostatical Union.</p>

                     <hi>Adam</hi> in his Integrity, and the glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels had nothing <hi>in them</hi> that inclined them to Sin.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:101491:101"/> As they came out of <hi>God's</hi> Hand, there was a pure and entire Goodness in them; only they were in a <hi>Possibility</hi> of Defection: Their <hi>actual</hi> Defection, in the first Disposition to Sin, arose from their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting loose the Reins of the Government of their <hi>own Spirits,</hi> which they ought to have preserved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted, and had <hi>Power</hi> to do so.</p>
                  <p>But how much more have we need to put the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle on <hi>our Spirits,</hi> that are already so full of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and wholly ingaged under the Power of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to an Indisposition and aversion to Good, and a violent Disposition to Evil till sanctified? <hi>And God saw that the Wickedness of Man was great up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, and that every Imagination of the</hi>

                  <p>A Spirit of <hi>Power</hi> derived from the Spirit that is almighty sanctifies all our Powers, and renders the Political Powers, which are <hi>of</hi> God, to be <hi>for</hi> God; and that cannot be for the hurt, at least for the Injury of any.

               <p>I shall improve this Doctrine for the Reproof of five sorts of Men.</p>
               <p>And First, <hi>of those who ambitiously reach at that Greatness above others, which God hath made none of their Duty, and hath set out of their Reach; and in the mean time are wholly unconcerned for this far greater Excellency that God hath made their Duty, and put within their Power by Divine promised Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> scil. <hi>the Rule of their own Spirits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What projecting, intrigueing, troubling the World and themselves, does the whole Life, and all its powers of many Men resolve themselves into, for no other end but to top others in the <hi>Shadows</hi> of Greatness; but to govern <hi>themselves,</hi> which is both true Greatness and <hi>Goodness,</hi> are the serious
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:101491:103"/> Thoughts and industry but of a very few. God, who is the most perfect Understanding and Truth, hath told us wherein Goodness and real Tranquillity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists; who are the best of Men, and the most happy; that how low soever our Station is in the World, we are capable of this Felicity, that 'tis to be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with much greater Certainty, and upon far better Terms: But we will have none of this; but that which of it self is of as small a value as vexatious Vanity, and to most, both unlawful and impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.<note place="margin">Psal. 4. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O ye Sons of Men! How long will ye turn my Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into Shame? How long will you love Vanity and seek after leasing? Selah. But know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself.</hi> And who is this godly Man, but he that sincerely endeavours to rule his Affections, and consequently his Life to a Conformity to God's Law? This is the Man that he has marked out for the <hi>wise and good</hi> Man, meet for his Favour, his Service, his Approbation, and his Portion among Men. And what and <hi>whose</hi> Portion they must be that are rejected of God, I will leave to you to determine, when your Thoughts are serious.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It reproves those who value themselves by their having other Men under their Feet.</hi> This may signify their Might, but not their Goodness at all.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:101491:103"/> Philosophers, that they have been sold for <hi>Slaves;</hi> and the greatest Worthies among the Saints have been Martyrs and Confessors; and in the purest Times of the Church, Christians and Christianity were so low, that they were the Scorn of the <hi>Jews</hi> and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and accounted the Off-scouring of all things; yea the Lord of Glory was under the power of not only <hi>Pilate</hi> but the meanest of his Souldiers, to wound and mock him at their Pleasure.</p>
               <p>Alas! What Glory is it for one Man, one <hi>Party</hi> to tread on the Neck of another? But this is a Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a Folly we are too well acquainted with, yet the worst of all is, that Men value themselves by it as the <hi>better</hi> Men, and the weak World strike in with the Conceit as ungrounded and foolish as it is. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperum scelus virtus vocatur.</hi> The People will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly take them to be best who are uppermost; and if Christ be on the Cross, the unthinking Vulgar will repute him a great Malefactor. Let not the wise Man glory in his Wisdom, nor let the mighty Man glory <hi>in his Might, nor the rich Man glory in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 9. 23.</note>
                  <hi>his Riches.</hi> What then should they glory in? In un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and knowing God, to exercise Loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness, Judgment and Righteousness in the Earth, and to have that sense of him, as to govern our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits by so just and benign a Pattern.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>It reproves those who follow their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Passions without consulting their Superiors,</hi> i. e. <hi>their Ʋnderstandings and Consciences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly such Men who wear their Spectacles on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their <hi>Pockets,</hi> or forget to open their <hi>Eyes</hi> when they move on a Precipice, are as wise and self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent as these. There are a sort of People in the World, whose Passions sally out without Direction,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:101491:104"/> Correction, or Self-examination: The <hi>Egyptians</hi> painted an inconsiderate Man with the Globe of the Earth before him, and a Looking-Glass behind him. These are the <hi>wild Asses used to the Wilderness, who</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 2. 24.</note>
                  <hi>snuff up the Wind at their Pleasure, who feed upon Ashes; a deceived Heart hath turned them aside, so</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 44. 20.</note>
                  <hi>that they cannot say, is there not a Lie in my right Hand?</hi> They abandon Reason as an useless thing, or as a Rub in that way which they are resolved in right or wrong: This is (I will not say unchristianing, but) <hi>unmanning</hi> themselves.</p>
               <p>He that best knows the Nature of such Degenerates, gives them their due Characters and proper Names; and tells us, that <hi>Man that is in Honour, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ps. 49. 20.</note>
                  <hi>not, is like the Beasts that perish.</hi> Let a Man be accomplished with any or all the titular Dignities that other Men can put upon him; if his Understanding be not his Master and Tutor; if he cast off those Reins of Government, consult nothing but his own Interest (as Men love to call their unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Appetites) he conforms to the Brute, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes himself to his Sensuality, as if he had to do with nothing more noble and worthy. <hi>But what</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jude 10.</note>
                  <hi>they know naturally as brute Beasts, therein do they corrupt themselves.</hi> Under this Cognisance the Lord takes them; <hi>Hear this Word ye Kine of Bashan.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amos 4. 1.</note> Upon this Text one gives this Paraphrase; <hi>Great Men who consult not their Ʋnderstandings for the Conduct of their Actions, are but great Beasts.</hi> And such Beasts are little Men too, who follow the same Tract, only they are of the lesser Herds of Cattel. <hi>Be not like the Horse or the Mule without Ʋnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that must be held in with Bit and Bridle.</hi> He that is so unlike a Man as to have nothing to do with
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:101491:104"/> his Understanding deserves the Bit and Bridle of a Horse: If he will not rule his own Spirit by his own Vertue, he must be ruled with the Bit and Bridle of an outward restraint from another Hand. <hi>Non caret regiâ Potestate, qui corpore suo noverit rationabiliter</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aust. in Sent.</note>
                  <hi>imperare: That Man</hi> (and that Man only) <hi>who knows how to govern himself by his own Reason, needs no Royal Authority but his own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, It reproves those, <hi>whose blind and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Will and Affections fight against and master the Dictates of the Ʋnderstanding, and Authority of their Consciences.</hi> To go on carelesly <hi>without</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting our Understandings, and what Directions it may afford us, is a Contempt of the Law of our Duty, and the means of our Welfare: but to act <hi>against</hi> them is Presumption, Scorn, and flat Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion against God in our Consciences. It is a <hi>black</hi> Brand on those of whom it is said, <hi>These are of them</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 24. 13.</note>
                  <hi>who rebel against the Light, they know not the Ways thereof, nor abide in the Paths thereof:</hi> But if 'tis said, <hi>they know not the ways thereof;</hi> so that 'tis at <hi>most</hi> but a Sin of Ignorance: I answer, no such matter! They <hi>know</hi> but will not <hi>acknowledg;</hi> they behave themselves <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding</hi> their Knowledg, as if they were <hi>utterly</hi> ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, which is an high Aggravation of their Sin: and when by God Men are <hi>judicially</hi> given up to this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, 'tis a Token of his highest Displeasure in this World, a Reservation in those Chains of Darkness, which are like to hold them till the Judgment of the great Day. <hi>For the Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all Ʋngodliness and Ʋnrighteousness of Men, who hold the Truth in Ʋnrighteousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Because that which may be known of God</hi> (i. e. his Being and their Duty) <hi>is manifest in them, for God
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:101491:105"/> hath shewed it unto them.</hi> In short, they oppressed and fought against their Light till they put it quite out, and all in favour of those unruly Affections and Lusts, which by it were made <hi>uneasy</hi> to them. For this Rebellion against their Light God gave them their Swing, and left them to embrace without <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul</hi> the grossest Follies, and most unbecoming ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Creatures. That Advice of an Heathen therefore, <hi>reverere seipsum,</hi> was the Voice of a <hi>wise</hi> Man for he that hath not an awful regard of the Light and Authority of his own Understanding and Conscience, is a <hi>dissolute</hi> Wretch, who hath burst the Bands, and broken the Cords, by which the supreme and sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Authority holds Men to their Duty to him, to their Neighbour, and themselves.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>It reproves them who abandon themselves to the arbitrary Conduct of others without concerning their own Judgments and Ʋnderstandings, in the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of its Truth or Goodness.</hi> And I must say that of all Men they run most headlong into Error and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manliness, who will be at no farther Pains to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what becomes them in <hi>their</hi> Places, what to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain as their <hi>Opinion,</hi> what in their Practice; than only what such a Man says and does, whose Reasons may be as weak, whose Authority as little, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives as unreasonable as their own. We decry the giving up our <hi>Judicium Discretionis,</hi> and yet do it where there is not the least Shadow for it to a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Man: What Advantage is it to decline our our own Ignorance and inordinate and irregular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, and follow anothers blind-fold. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Examples of a good and wise Man ought to weigh somewhat with us; but not so much as to determine us without farther Examination. God
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:101491:105"/> alone is so wise as not possibly to be mistaken, and so good and just as he cannot injure his Creatures: a perfect and absolute deference to him is our duty and safety. I will thank my fellow-servant to lend me his eyes, that I may see better with mine own: but, I will not so abuse his eyes as to put out mine own. God hath given to every Man a Guide in his <hi>own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,</hi> which with all other helps is to be his <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> Controuler and Director. I know not any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission we have to devolve its office upon a proxy. It is as reasonable, and as <hi>eligible,</hi> to commit it to others to eat and to drink for us, as to <hi>understand</hi> for us. <hi>Let every Man prove his own work; then shall he</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 4.</note>
                  <hi>have rejoycing</hi> in <hi>himself alone, and not in another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I would not forget to mind those, whose Lusts and Passions have misled and dethroned their own Judgments, and Consciences; and yet are not <hi>so content,</hi> but give up themselves to a sort of Men, who are greater Masters of Misrule, and Doctors in Debauchery and Vice; that they wofully transgress this Doctrine of the excellency of a Mans governing his own Spirit. Is it not enough, and infinitely too much, for a Man indued with reason to turn Rebel, and subdue it by his own unreasonable appetite; but he must call in the greatest offenders against this Law, and submit himself wholly to their conduct? How many in our day go to school to learn the Art of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning more sinfully, and chuse such wicked Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions for their patterns, who are most perfect in Villany; and can with the most scorn, and least sense of all that is venerable, not only satisfie, but <hi>inflame</hi> their Pride and Luxury, and all Licentiousness! Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if it be an unmanly error, to follow the tract of the better sort of men without examination; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:101491:106"/> cause they may be misled themselves, or mislead o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by their own Passions: It is a Crime, an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormity for which no name is bad enough, to give up our selves to the misrule of the worst of Men; and for this very cause or motive, that they are more wicked; and can give us Instructions and Examples of Sinning, and gratifying our corrupt Affections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our selves, or any others.</p>
               <p>Lastly, <hi>It reproves those above all others, whose Judgments and Ʋnderstandings are given up and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted to the service of sinful passions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a most lamentable inversion of that <hi>Order,</hi> which God hath created in his creature Man; a turning it <hi>up-side down,</hi> a most direct and diametrical opposition to the Divine Institution. It is Man's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency to rule his own Spirit by a sanctified Reason: but he is so far faln from that, his Reason so unsan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, as to turn it into a Slave and Vassal to his Lusts.</p>
               <p>This Men do, when their Understandings have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, but to make Provision for the Flesh to fulfil the Lusts thereof, and when that is done, to justify and turn Advocate for Sin.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures give us many sad Instances of this, of a whole <hi>Generation that are pure in their own eyes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 30. 12.</note>
                  <hi>and yet are not cleansed from their filthiness.</hi> Their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are so far polluted, as to justify them from any <hi>degree</hi> of Faultiness in the greatest degrees of <hi>Pollution.</hi> It tells us of Men that <hi>are wise to do Evil, but to do</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 4. 22.</note>
                  <hi>Good have no Knowledg.</hi> And what is this but a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal giving up their Understanding to plot, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive the gratifying of sinful Passions; a Sagacity, and reach, a cunning for nothing else. This is the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which <hi>is not from above</hi> (and whence 'tis then
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:101491:106"/> you may guess) <hi>but 'tis earthly, sensual, devilish.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 3. 15.</note> The Faculty of Understanding is from above, and placed in Man to tread under Foot these vile Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but so to abuse it, as to be a Contriver for, a Promoter of what comes under any of these three Taints, is not from the pure Fountain above, but from the Sourse beneath, the bottomless Pit of Sin, Folly and Misery.</p>
               <p>To have our Understandings so much abased, as to serve no higher Ends than earthly things, 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a poor, low, restrained, imprisoned thing; it digs for Riches, but they are <hi>earthly</hi> Riches, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses of shining Clay, extention of Houses, Lands, which one calls <hi>Bona scabelli,</hi> the good things of God's Footstool, and such as he has placed under our Feet. This is making our Understandings Slaves to the Sin of Covetousness, which the only true God calls Idolatry. And tho Pride and Ambition look somewhat bigger than what may be tied up in a Bag, yet 'tis but earthly. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> thought his Wisdom and Understanding had been bravely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, when it had raised such a Morsel for his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition as his great <hi>Babylon;</hi> but God esteemed him a Beast for using his Understanding no better, and turns him among the Herd to admonish himself and others to employ it better.</p>
               <p>But to have our superior Faculties serve mere Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualities, is yet a greater Abuse. This is for Man to become <hi>brutish in his Knowledg,</hi> which is complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of by God as a wosul Degeneracy. For a Man<note place="margin">Jer. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 14.</note> to slave his Understanding, to provide what may most gratify the Lusts of the Eye, and the Lusts of the Flesh, by a voluptuous eating, drinking, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:101491:107"/> hearing, and the touches of Uncleanness, is more base than Bestiality it self; for though the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of their Heaven be the gratifyings of Sense, they know their <hi>Measure,</hi> and where left to themselves, act most exactly according to that Law of Self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, and what is peculiar to their several <hi>Species,</hi> for their delights.</p>
               <p>Yet Mens Understandings sink lower, even to drudg to <hi>Devilism;</hi> to contrive for, and to justify Envy, Revenge, Enmity, Cruelty, all manner of Mischief; yea, to turn Tempters to Soul-damning Sin, and taking pleasure in tormenting (not Beasts, but) Men. I forbear to give Examples of these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral degrees of Sin, which have devoured Mens Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and Consideration in their Service. If I should tell you of a <hi>Crassus,</hi> a <hi>Midas,</hi> a <hi>Demas,</hi> an <hi>Achan,</hi> a <hi>Judas,</hi> who put Christ himself into his Bag; an <hi>Alexander,</hi> a <hi>Julius Caesar, Ahab, Jeze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, Nero, Sardanapalus;</hi> some it may be would stay their thoughts in them, as if such unreasonable and reason-prostituting Men were rare things: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeed, this Disease is Epidemical, Common, and in some degree Universal.</p>
               <p>But where this Crime is reigning, 'tis but playing the Fool with all our Cunning, and sinning the more profoundly. To be brutish in our <hi>Affections,</hi> is very unbecoming a <hi>rational</hi> Creature; but to have our Understandings <hi>approving</hi> and serving brutish Lusts is far <hi>worse;</hi> the greatest degeneracy we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of in this World. And it seems as if intended to express the <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> of the <hi>possible</hi> defection of Man from his Integrity, to have his <hi>Mind and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science defiled, i. e.</hi> to have sentiments, and give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 15.</note> agreeable to inordinate Affections: <hi>If the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:101491:107"/> light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness?</hi>
               </p>

                  <head>SECT. II.</head>
                  <p>We shall next consider some Instructions to our Understandings this Doctrine affords us.</p>
                  <p>And first, it informs us <hi>how we are to judg of Mens Excellencies, Goodness or Worthiness.</hi> Not by their Greatness and Might with respect to others, but by that Dominion they have and exercise over their <hi>own Spirits.</hi> He is an <hi>Hero indeed</hi> who is his own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: He is a Grandee, and as good as he is great, that by his Understanding taking its Light from the Word of God, governs and keeps in order his own Affections. Such a Man has the Empire of a whole World, a <hi>lesser</hi> World, but of more value than the <hi>greater.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They who judg of Goodness by such outward Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances as agree to common Opinion and mere Pageantry, judge according to Appearances, but not righteous Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This informs us that there are but a few Men in the World that are excellent Men. <hi>My Goodness extendeth not to thee,</hi> (saith <hi>David) but</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ps. 3. 16.</note>
                     <hi>to the Saints that are on the Earth, and to the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in whom is all my Delight.</hi> But who are these Excellent ones? why they are <hi>Saints,</hi> such who <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 7.</note>
                     <hi>themselves</hi> (as the Apostle speaks) <hi>unto God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,</hi> have their Heads and Hearts employed to the ordering their <hi>Conversation aright,</hi> both that <hi>without,</hi> and that <hi>within:</hi> Who are upright before God, and <hi>keep themselves</hi> from <hi>their Iniquity.</hi> But these are a very few comparatively. Among the Throng of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:101491:108"/> People that are in the world, 'tis the Lot of but a few to be Noble, Rich or Great; and I fear 'tis the choice of fewer to be in good earnest in this cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersom unpleasing-work to the Flesh, of ruling their own Spirit. In all Places and Societies of Men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Spirits banish the Delight and Profit of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian and humane Converse, and make but an ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favoured Representation of Christianity. 'Tis a rare thing to meet with a Man whom you shall be sure to find in the Path of Reason and Christian Duty, who needs no other Motives to be what he ought to be, than what he carries alway in his own Bosom. And I would I could say of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> that they were <hi>generally</hi> a People of this Excellency commended, such as have <hi>crucified the Flesh with its Affections and Lusts;</hi> whose enlightned Understandings and Consciences had a powerful Influence to restrain their Passions, when under no Temptation but of natural Humours. True Notions of Truth and Duty, a Track of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, with some professed Approbations of the things that are excellent, is the utmost Limit of most Mens Religion. What Crookedness, Perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Worldliness, Sensuality, Pride, Frowardness were the Symptons of their unbridled Spirits long since, continues the same, and are more unchanged than their Faces: Their Graces seem powerless, and short of the Effects of <hi>moral</hi> Vertue: yea good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or good Breeding have much a fairer <hi>Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> and render their Societies who rise no higher (at least) less offensive. There may be true Grace <hi>within,</hi> Charity may suggest so much, when 'tis as a Candle in so <hi>foul</hi> a Lanthorn, as not only its <hi>use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Shine</hi> is withdrawn, but also its <hi>being</hi> there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:101491:108"/> most invisible. But let me make bold to tell Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, that have no better Proof of their being <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Power of Darkness, and translated into the Kingdom of the dear Son of God,</hi> that they put their eternal Estate to a very great hazard.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This Doctrine informs us, <hi>how happy and blessed the Heaven of the Blessed will be.</hi> There will be this Goodness in its Perfection, there will be no pricking Briars nor grieving Thorns of unmortified unbridled Passions in others, or our selves. Into that place shall enter nothing that doth offend. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that is crooked here, shall be found streight there. Humour, carnal Interest, Flattery, Opinion are not the Byass of that thorowly reformed World. All there is naked Plainness and perfect <hi>Beauty,</hi> that needs none of the Masques and Disguises which Men use here to cover those Disorders in their Affections, which they have no Will, and therefore no Power to cure.</p>
                  <p>This World is not worth the living for, 'tis so rude a thing; Men who by Nature are fitted for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful and useful Society, are become the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and troublesom of the whole Creation. We know not where to be, but we find it a <hi>Meshek</hi> or a <hi>Kedar.</hi> How gladded will a Soul, disposed for, and assured of that blessed Rest, be at its Departure from so much Uneasiness from others, and from remaining Corruptions in her self, which as more near, and more its <hi>own Guilt,</hi> is more her own Disease and Grief? It is one of the good, if not of the best Improvements we can make of all the Evils we know, or do, or suffer here; to raise thereby the Price of Heaven in our Hearts, where none of that Disorder, Deformity and Bitterness will be found: And of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:101491:109"/> what Sparks or Drops of good we see, or taste here, to raise the Price of Heaven in our Hearts by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that all this Goodness will be there in Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. This will be the way to make our Mercies and Comforts more sweet and comfortable, and our Afflictions, yea our very Sins, less imbittering our Days.</p>
                  <q>The third Improvement we shall make of this Doctrine, will be of such things it puts us on the practice of.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> To call over the Records of our Memories and Consciences, that we may inform our selves how far, and wherein we are faln from this Excellency, the Rule of our own Spirits. It is certain that God invested Man with it in his first Creation, and as certain he never gave to any an Authority to divest us of it, nor have we his Warrant to neglect it, or discharge our selves. We had once a Right to this <hi>Empire</hi> of our own Spirits, and the Possession also: But woe is us! 'tis <hi>lost</hi> and hath been so time out of mind. If God should now demand of us an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our <hi>selves,</hi> how we have conserved this Trust, and maintain our Authority in its Vigour; what Answer should we make to the Supreme Lord? Alas we have cared so little for these things, that we can give no Account of them; they have not fallen under our Observation; we have not charged our selves with them as any part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince committed by the great Sovereign to our Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody. Our Wills have taken no Measures from our Understandings, nor our Understandings from that Law of the whole Creation, <hi>scil.</hi> to serve the Ends
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:101491:109"/> of our Being. There hath been an universal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy against the Divine Right, and that Order he has commanded. Not only our Love, Hatred, Joy, Sorrow, Desire, Aversation have been licentious and run riot, been a Sort of <hi>Self-movers;</hi> but our Wills and Understandings also have quit their Posts, and like treacherous Counsellors and Commanders in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, have taken part with, and headed a Mutiny. We came into this World like corrupted troubled Springs, and have fallen in with the Stream of this <hi>Folly,</hi> and followed its Current into the dead Sea of Sin and Vanity, we knew not how nor asked why.

Rouse up thy self therefore, let thy Reason (submitted and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God) take the Throne, lay its Commands on thy Affections, and force their Obedience: <hi>Keep thine

                     <hi>Put a Remark upon the Disorders in the Spirits of others, more especially in thine own,</hi> with their Causes, that renders the World involv'd in so much Confusion, and wherein this great Duty of Self-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is most neglected, and most apparently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured.</p>
                  <p>I shall endeavour to give a Prospect of some few of them, and leave you to enlarge by your own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First, It appears in the perverse and contentious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to whatever is our own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alas! what proper rational Evidence is there of Worth or Goodness in any thing because it is <hi>ours?</hi> Because 'tis our Opinion, our Party, our Relation, our Interest? Yet under this only Consideration, or rather from these Motives without any farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, not only the above-named, but our very Sins, Lusts and Follies are passionately espoused. If our Spirits were regulated as they ought, we would
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:101491:110"/> love Truth as <hi>Truth,</hi> and Goodness as <hi>Goodness</hi> wherever we find it: and what is contrary should have none of our Countenance. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 3.</note> would needs have the Image in the Plain of <hi>Dura</hi> worshipped by all, because it was of <hi>his</hi> setting up. The Disciples of Christ had not well learned what the best of Masters taught them, when they would have <hi>their</hi> Mouths stopped who followed not <hi>them,</hi> and for no other cause. I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> and I of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and I of <hi>Cephas,</hi> and I of Christ was no Symptom of well-govern'd Spirits among the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Christianity. And if the Order wherein these Parties are expressed may signify any thing 'tis this, that where Men prefer in the <hi>first</hi> place their own Passions, Christ will be so far put behind as to become <hi>last</hi> of all. But these things, and their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>puffed up for one against another,</hi> were their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and so notorious Follies and unbridled Passions, that the Apostle does not nakedly say they were <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;</hi> but makes them their own Judges, puts it to their own Consciences if they were not so; <hi>Are ye</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, This unruled Spirit appears in Mens Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience of Contradiction however reasonable.</hi> Men when having obtained some Reputation for Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Wisdom, Parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a Spirit of Pride sensually plucks the Reins of their own Spirits out of their Hands: They will rather run into twenty Errors in word or deed, than acknowledge themselves guilty of one, or leave him a Saver that will not go out of the way with <hi>them,</hi> as well as <hi>in</hi> it.</p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:101491:111"/>
                  <p>Who would think that so many should be ambitious of being thought infallible themselves, who seem to be so much against that Character on any? <hi>Vain Man</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 11. 12</note>
                     <hi>would be wise, tho he be born as a wild Asses Colt.</hi> It were well if he would <hi>be</hi> so: But the Sense is, he would be <hi>thought</hi> so, and is more fond of being thought so, than of being so <hi>indeed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How impatient was <hi>Zedekiah</hi> of Contradiction, that he could not forbear in the presence of two Kings, and many Princes and Nobles, to smite <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah</hi> (that honest <hi>Tell-Truth</hi>) on the Cheek. This was certainly a Token that the Spirit of the Lord was gone from <hi>him</hi> (whether it went to <hi>Micaiah</hi> or not) and that he had lost also the Rule of his <hi>own</hi> Spirit. This impatience of Contradiction has been the cause of many a <hi>feverish</hi> Heat in some Men, from whose Examples might be expected the most eminent Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of <hi>Humility.</hi> And if we think this ungoverned Spirit is not to be found but in the <hi>worst</hi> of Men, or at least not to be found in those we judg and rank a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the best; we may sooner or later find our selves <hi>mistaken.</hi> Knowledg, or Learning and Parts, have not alway Grace growing up <hi>equally</hi> with them. I may be bold to say, that if Humility be the <hi>Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> Daughter of Knowledg, Pride is its Daughter too, tho I confess 'tis not Legitimate, but a <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Knowledg <hi>puffeth</hi> up, but Grace edifieth, <hi>i. e.</hi> Knowledg fills Men as a Bladder with that windy Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but Grace makes Men truly Great and Good. Who would have thought that such a Man as <hi>Jonah</hi> should be so impatient of a <hi>seeming</hi> Contradiction to his Prophecy, from the Divine Pity it self, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a false Prophet, from the Construction
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:101491:111"/> Fools would make of that compassionate and tender Mercy, which is alway implied upon Repentance: Yet so it was, and so unequally, as well as feverish did his Pulse beat, that he justified his Anger against God himself (for who else could he be angry with?) for smiting his Mushroom Gourd, but could have had Patience enough, and it may be some <hi>Pleasure too,</hi> to see his Prophecy <hi>confirmed,</hi> by the Destruction of so many thousand Innocents (among greater Sinners) as dwelt in that great City <hi>Nineveh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This ungoverned Spirit appears in Men's so easily shifting, and changing Opinions, Professions, and Communions.</p>
                  <p>I do not, I dare not say, that when there is a just Evidence of our being in an Error, we must not change an Error for a <hi>Truth:</hi> That were to give unto a perverse Stubbornness, the Honour of a well-prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled Stability. I do not here concern my self with those who under any Profession of Religion <hi>whatever,</hi> have no design above the low Things of this World. We must expect (say what can be said) that such will admit of no Godliness that crosses worldly Gain. But I speak of, and to, such who do so easily shift and change Principles, and think they do their Duty, and give good satisfaction to God and their own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and it may be take themselves to be so much the better and more genuine Christians.</p>
                  <p>Some who I hope are real Christians (but I must needs say are very weak) if they hear a Man speak good Words, and such as it may be contain Truths worthy our acknowledgment; presently grow fond of all that Person holds or practises in the matters of Religion. Is not such a sally of the Affections with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Bit or Reigns, which a very mean Understanding
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:101491:112"/> may afford them? I would ask such, if they might not as reasonably turn to every Opinion of <hi>every</hi> Man, that saith somewhat more or less that affects them? and then they must, or <hi>may</hi> shift all Points of the Compass in a short time, and hold all true that any Man holds, who doth so far gratify them as was said before.</p>
                  <p>Others, when any thing is said to them for a new Opinion, or contrary to their old Sentiments, which they cannot answer presently; they forsake what they formerly held and professed, and upon good grounds too: Only they knew not how to manage them, and are captivated by the Assailant. If these are not <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren tossed to and fro with every wind of Doctrine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 14.</note> those words of Holy Writ have no meaning: For, let another deal with them <hi>against</hi> those Arguments that altered them <hi>before,</hi> and say more than they know how to answer; must they not face about as they <hi>were,</hi> or be as partial now, as before they were both weak and imprudent? Do these poor Souls rule their own Spirits, or their Spirits rule them? Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they not neither ruling nor ruled, but poor passive indifferent things, roul'd to and again with a Breath? Do these People believe that all Truth stands on their Legs, and if their strength cannot sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, it must fall to the Ground and be an Error?</p>
                  <p>But I must drive it a little farther. These Persons (for the more part) are surely within the reach of some more <hi>knowing,</hi> and as <hi>sincere</hi> for Truth as themselves: And most of them (I suppose) have some or other Pastors, who by their <hi>own Choice</hi> have a particular Charge and Care of their Souls. I find but very <hi>few</hi> of them (upon such Temptations) who will have recourse to them, to try what satisfaction they can
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:101491:112"/> give them against the Adversaries Arguments, and to retain them in their former Principles. Doth not this give abundant evidence, that they are so far chain'd by their <hi>precipitate</hi> Choice of a <hi>new Opinion,</hi> that they are afraid of being better informed, and re-established? This is the very Truth of most of these Men's shifting Principles. And I dare say these Persons neither rule their own Spirits according to <hi>their</hi> Portion of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, nor know what manner of Spirit they are of. And I will add, that beside their unfaithfulness to Truth and their own Souls; they cannot be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from perfidiousness too, and wronging and griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those who are over them in the Lord. And I pray God to furnish his Church with such Pastors, whose Knowledg may enable them, and whose Integrity may dispose them (like their Lord) to have pity on the Ignorant, and those who are out of the way; and to carry it with that sweetness of Love, Humility, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Self-Denial; as may incourage poor Souls in their difficulties to expect their Help. I have said thus much not partially for this or that Persuasion in the Matters of Religion, but from an <hi>impartial</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Souls, and their <hi>stability</hi> in the Truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It appears <hi>in the prevalency of corrupt Passions, in giving and receiving Reproofs or Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> I must acknowledg, that it requires much of a Spirit of Wisdom, Love, Meekness, and Imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality to discharge <hi>either</hi> of these parts becoming Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: A wise Reprover, and an obedient Ear, seldom meet. There is a Humour runs in the Veins of all Men (few excepted) to have every Body under check but themselves; a strange inclination to, and fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a Self-Indulgence <hi>Ʋniversal,</hi> without regard to what is right or meet.</p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:101491:113"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> that Pattern of <hi>singular</hi> Meekness, reproves (with a Meekness like himself) a <hi>Brother</hi> Hebrew,<note place="margin">Exod. 2. 13.</note> from <hi>brotherly</hi> Love; <hi>Why smitest thou thy Fellow?</hi> The Text tells us that his Reproof was to him that <hi>did</hi> the <hi>wrong:</hi> Yet, he met with so sharp, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Reception, as made him flee his Countrey. A <hi>sad</hi> Reward for his Charity! He was paid off with Wrong, and Revenge, and Railery: <hi>Who made thee a Judg?</hi> there's <hi>Railery. Wilt thou kill me?</hi> there's a false Accusation: <hi>As thou didst the Egyptian Yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day:</hi> there's <hi>Revenge</hi> added to both the other. That advice of our Saviour, <hi>Cast not your Pearls before Swine, lest they turn again and rent you;</hi> seems to<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 9.</note>
                     <hi>most,</hi> a sufficient discharge from all <hi>reproving;</hi> Men are generally become so <hi>Swinish;</hi> having so little rule of their own Spirits. He that reproves, must not <hi>only cloath</hi> himself with Wisdom, Love, and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but he must also <hi>arm</hi> himself with the greatest Patience and Fortitude.</p>
                  <p>This difficulty and danger of reproving has turn'd Friendship into <hi>unfaithful</hi> Silence, or a more pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Flattery: But it is better to love with this Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than to deceive with Flattery. I have thought sometimes to restrain Reproof to the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> would be the wisest way in a Minister; Because, that leaves the particular Application to the Hearer's own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: But, this tho the most wary, as well as autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative, does not alway secure him from the charge of a false, or malicious Accuser, of a particular Person, or Busie-Body, tho he has neither had <hi>that</hi> Offender, nor any <hi>particular</hi> Person in his Thoughts: Of this many sad and revengeful Instances might be given. Thus Men like foolish Children, hate, if not <hi>break</hi> the Looking-Glass, that shews them the <hi>Dirt or Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:101491:113"/> of their Faces, but hereby they discover their Souls more foul and deformed. I have no small Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of that of <hi>Bernard, Omnia enim in confessione</hi>

                  <p>The Reproved are commonly of the unruly Spirit we have observed, and much more might be said: But, the Reprover commonly is as little concerned to manage his Spirit in giving, as the Reproved in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Rebuke. Some Persons have such an itch of reproving, that they <hi>must</hi> be at <hi>that</hi> work; and are as busy to seek it, as the Fly to find the sore place. These make other Mens <hi>Sores</hi> smart, to please and tickle, their <hi>own</hi> Itch. Some Men reprove in Wrath and Anger, as if they hated the Persons more than the Vices they reproved.</p>

                  <p>And whereas Love and Wisdom would, that as bitter Pills are wrapped in <hi>Gold,</hi> and a sowre Portion made more tolerable by <hi>sweetning;</hi> so Reproofs should be prefaced with due Commendations, of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and <hi>worth</hi> of the Person reproved, and Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of good Will, with all the mollifying terms the nature of the Fault, and the hope of the Cure will bear. This was the great Example of Christ the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wisdom,</hi> in five of his Epistles to the seven Churches of <hi>Asia;</hi> worthy to be considered by all in<note place="margin">Rev. chap. 2. &amp; 3.</note> giving Reproof.

And as little Judgment and Charity to consider and weigh with our selves before-hand, what may be said for the Person supposed Faulty, by which we should put our selves in his Case.

                     </gap>t appeared in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> writing an Epistle of Reproof to the Church at <hi>Corinth:</hi> I will give you a <hi>shred</hi> for a Sample. <hi>Haec Clarissimi, non tantum ut vos officii vestri admoneamus scribimus, sedut nos ipsos commone faciamus; In eodem enim stadio versamur, &amp; certa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men idem nobis impendit. i. e.</hi> Dear Brethren, We write these things, to advise <hi>not you only</hi> of your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but with you <hi>our selves</hi> also: For indeed, we are in the same Fault with you, and labour under the same Disease and Difficulties. To conclude, I know no Action wherein Men do so rarely on the active or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive part, so much as design to govern their own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: For which cause, Reproofs seldom are given but it comes to a down-right Quarrel, and wounding, instead of healing, is the work on both Hands.</p>

                     <hi>Plato</hi> had indeed the art of reproving an <hi>ill-taught</hi> Reprover, and striking the Quarrel dead with one soft, but <hi>heavy</hi> Blow. <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Father of the Cynicks, that is, of the cross-grain'd, unmannerly Humourists, who are for pleasing no Body but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; He being in <hi>Plato</hi>'s Lodgings, and seeing there a delicate Bed, and very rich, gets him up with his dirty Feet on the Bed, and tramples it to its great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composure, and prejudice, crying out; <hi>Now I tread</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>This unruled Spirit among Men, appears in the great Incongruity of Men's Ʋnderstandings, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, Approbations, and their own Practices: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much burden to, or complaint of themselves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Truth is, the World is full of Knowledg, and Christianity mightily advanced among us, if its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines reached not to either <hi>Heart or Life:</hi> But, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom both Human and Divine, which is the <hi>practick Knowledg,</hi> is sunk to a very low ebb. But what is the matter, that Men look so high, and live so low? talk like Men, like Saints, or Angels, and walk like Crabs? It is because they are not concerned in ruling their own Spirits; <hi>Affections inordinate</hi> have gotten the Mastery, and keep <hi>quiet</hi> Possession. It hath been said of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Stage-Players, that for that <hi>Stage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> they had so furnished themselves with excellent <hi>Sentences,</hi> that honest and wise Men were ashamed to use them, after such Slaves to their Lusts, had so <hi>defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, they who consider what Christianity is commended to us in our Bible, how we generally commend, and pretend to have a dear and awful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to it; and also how <hi>contrary</hi> and unbecoming it our Deportment to God and Men are: I say, such will conclude that either we understand not our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or do not believe it; or we have no care to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our Spirits. It is true, that the best of Men come short of their Knowledg in their Lives: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Paul</hi> himself saith, <hi>To will is present with me,</hi>

Who shall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me from the Body of this Death?</hi> I take it to be neither boldness nor uncharitableness to affirm, that where with the Knowledg, the <hi>Grace of God is in Truth,</hi> tho there may be, and <hi>is</hi> too great a Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the Practice to the Understanding, and the taint of natural Corruptions will not be <hi>quite</hi> wrought out; yet, there is a <hi>sincere</hi> design, a <hi>purpose of Heart,</hi> to reduce outward Acts, and inward Dispositions to a conformity to our Understandings, and that where it is so, there will be apparently <hi>some</hi> Bridle of Restraint: Pride, Anger, Frowardness, Covetousness, Hatred, Contention, and other enormous Lusts, will not riot it, and have so free and beaten a Road, as where there is no such Self-Rule sincerely determined.</p>
                  <p>There will be a Change for the better, a <hi>stated</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to purify our selves even as God is pure. Where Men understand the proper ways of their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and that they are necessary to answer the ends of a comfortable living in the World, and yet are not to be found ordinarily in them, but in Idleness and ill Haunts, <hi>destructive</hi> to those Ways and Ends: Every wise Man will conclude such to be a sort of dissolute Persons, <hi>i. e.</hi> ungoverned loose Men: such as have disbanded themselves from under the Authority of their Understandings, in <hi>those</hi> Concerns. It is no less a reasonable Conclusion, where the case is alike in Matters of Religion and our Eternal Concerns. And that there is such a looseness among Professors this day, from the Paths that are professedly leading to our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and true Felicity, needs no <hi>secret</hi> Search, no <hi>elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> Enquiries to find the sad proof of.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, It appears, <hi>in the unreasonable and sudden Alterations wrought on Mens Spirits, by not only great,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:101491:115"/> but small Changes and Provocations.</hi> By nothing more than this, is the unruliness of Men's Spirits to be discerned. Where is the Man that is <hi>semper idem?</hi> that has such a Poise on his Spirit, that he sinks not under a Change to Adversity, or over-sets not with a stiff Gale of Prosperity? <hi>I said in my Prosperity, I shall never be moved: Thou didst hide thy Face, and I was troubled.</hi> As good a Man as he was that said it, he said no more than what he had proved in his own <hi>unruly</hi> Heart: It was lifted up so high upon the weak moveable Waters of the World, that he had an unworthy Confidence in, and Opinion of his Stability on so <hi>poor</hi> a Foundation: It seemed to be a sudden <hi>transport</hi> of mind. But when God frown'd on him by <hi>adverse</hi> Providences, what became of his Confidence? where was his Mountain? He then had a Heart melted like Wax, his Spirit was as <hi>Water</hi> in a Storm all <hi>disordered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is said of our <hi>English</hi> Nation, that they hurry from one extream to another, are alway Strangers to <hi>Moderation.</hi> I was so self-indulging as not to believe it a long time, I took my own Nation (as plain Country People do) to be every way <hi>worthy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was mine <hi>own.</hi> But if this last Age hath not proved us more than <hi>disposed</hi> to Extreams, no Nation ever was proved so. Indeed we have been all in a <hi>Passion</hi> this Fifty Years and more. One Bucket is on the Seat, 'tother at the bottom of the Well. The Ball is gotten to this end of the Street, and there's the Shout <hi>now,</hi> and by and by to the other end, then the Shout is <hi>there;</hi> and they that Shouted before are <hi>Dumb,</hi> and have scarce Heart enough to keep them on their Feet. This is not the Spirit of the <hi>Boys only,</hi> 'tis theirs that
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:101491:116"/> are old enough to be Men. We cannot but play the <hi>Child,</hi> when we are mightily pleased, but when <hi>otherwise,</hi> we are all in the Dumps, or murmur; and 'tis well if God himself have a good Word from us.</p>
                  <p>If we consider <hi>another</hi> manner of Humour: When Men have gotten <hi>Power,</hi> then nothing but Tyranny, Domineering, Scorn, and Contempt of all <hi>Mankind</hi> except their <hi>Superiors:</hi> A Spirit full of Revenge and Cruelty; nothing more pleasant than to make <hi>them, especially</hi> who have wronged them, <hi>feel</hi> how big they now are, by laying all their weight on them, that they may expire in Groans. But let these very Men become <hi>low;</hi> their Hearts are in their Heels, no bigger than a Pease; they are shrunk into the most slavish, flattering Abjects imaginable: Such a pusillanimity is there among Men. And I know not how to reflect on such, as Men whose Superior Souls are any great Counsellors or Commanders in their little▪ World, or that Spirits so easily moved, or so far removed by outward Changes, can be truly Great, or well managed by the Judgment and Understanding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> This unbridled Spirit appears <hi>in Mens pursuit of the World.</hi> No bounds are given to the <hi>measure,</hi> nor means for obtaining it. The Word <hi>enough</hi> is one of the most <hi>unintelligible</hi> in our Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries. The Heart, Head, all the Powers are <hi>insla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> to <hi>its</hi> interest. It hath usurped the Place of God Himself. Men take all measures by it in matters both Civil, and Ecclesiastical: Love and Hatred, Court and Contempt, rise and fall at its beck. It answers all things, as far as the most violent Passions can carry
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:101491:116"/> it, which are become its perfect <hi>Slaves.</hi> In this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument there is Field-room enough to fill a Volume.</p>
                  <p>I would only ask a few Questions, and they are, What thinking Men say, preach and print of the Weight, Worth and necessity of that <hi>Measure</hi> of the World (if that word may pass for the present) which Men press unto? the Means and Spirits laid out to obtain it? the value of it when the most is made of it that can be possible? Really there is so general a Consent to what the Scripture speaks of its Vanity to those great Ends of Satisfaction, its Snares to intangle in all Evil, its Fumes and Vapours to intoxicate Men both seeking and finding it, desiring and possessing it; that we may call it by all the <hi>hard Names</hi> imaginable, charge its Idolatrizers with set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their <hi>Eyes</hi> and Hearts <hi>on that which is not,</hi> with all the Folly, Wrong to God, Ruin to their <hi>own Souls</hi> we can express: All Men generally (that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Religion or Reason) will say <hi>Amen</hi> to't, and (it may be) the Conscience of <hi>Guilt</hi> in this matter, and the Heart resolved notwithstanding to <hi>continue</hi> it, shall send forth a <hi>faint Sigh,</hi> and go away a little sad for the <hi>present,</hi> as the young Man after he had heard from Christ what was not fit for <hi>his</hi> turn.</p>
                  <p>Now considering that the things of the World are (at best and worst) such, and all consent to't, when their Judgments and <hi>Consciences</hi> speak; Where is the Rule and Government of Mens Spirits, that are so perfectly, violently and constantly contrary to those Sentiments? What Account can they give to themselves? or do they dare to call themselves to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Account at all in <hi>this</hi> matter? Certainly the God of this World cannot but laugh and triumph at this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most universal Folly and Madness, whereby Men with
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:101491:117"/> wind and stream are hurried on to serve his <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious</hi> Ends. <hi>Quem Deus pro malis suis abjicit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cassiodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, Omnia te expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant.</note>
                     <hi>fit Diaboli pabulum; quapropter si inescam inimici dari nolumus, non debemus esse terreni: Quia sic in Principio maledictus est, ut terram comedat.</hi> They whom God rejects, are the Devils Prey. Therefore if we would not be devoured by that Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, it becomes us to take heed of earthly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; because the Devil was in the Beginning cursed to have the Earth for his Morsels. A little grain of Salt for the strain of Wit usual with (otherwise) great Men in their day, and it carries in it a substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and useful Truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eighthly, In Anger, Lust and Revenge:</hi> I joyn all three under one Head; because they are the three greatest Furies in corrupted Nature; such as of all others disdain any Rule or Order; when once they have gotten the Bit in their Teeth. What a mad thing is Anger? He that cannot so rule his Spirit, as to preserve it from being at all prevailed on by this Passion, in vain doth he hope afterward to correct it, till it has with the fiercest Horse run it self out of Breath, or with the Waters broken over the Bank, spent their Torrent. This Passion is of all others the least guilty of <hi>Hypocrisy,</hi> but of all others is the most impudent, for it exposes its Fury in all the Features of the Face, in Looks full of Terror and threatning; a Tongue set on fire of Hell, Actions and Gestures so uncomely, so inconsiderate, that it differs nothing from stark Madness, only in Duration. It is <hi>Furor brevis,</hi> it is so void of all Deference to the Understanding, that it will have an absolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty or <hi>Tyranny;</hi> All true it saith, all <hi>Good</hi> it doth, when 'tis most uncapable of either. <hi>Nulli
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:101491:117"/> irascenti sua Ira videtur injusta:</hi> And it hath one<note place="margin">Aust.</note> Quality peculiarly unreasonable, that nothing more inflames it than to be opposed with <hi>Reason.</hi> And certainly Men under this Distemper, if they had Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er equal to their Passion, nothing would end it but the End and Destruction of its Objects. Therefore our Saviour makes it a degree of <hi>Murder.</hi> It is a dangerous Companion to our selves and others, fit to<note place="margin">Prov. 21. 19.</note> live no where but alone; <hi>'tis better to live in a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness than with an angry Woman. Make no Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with an angry Man, and with a furious Man</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 22. 24.</note>
                     <hi>thou shalt not go; lest thou learn his Ways, and get a Snare to thy Soul.</hi> So far is an angry Person from the Rule of his own Spirit, that he is not fit for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
                  <p>Lust, so far as it prevails, is no less a Sympton of an unbridled Spirit, of the Understanding dethroned. When once this Evil hath touched and infected the Heart, 'tis it <hi>alone</hi> possesses all the Powers. What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of <hi>David</hi>'s Piety or Humanity? What Token left of any thing of a Man of Understanding, much less of a Man after God's own Heart, when his inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Affection had fastned on <hi>Bathsheba?</hi> What did he stick at to accomplish and continue his unchast De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. Give me <hi>Dinah,</hi> said <hi>Shecem,</hi> let the Dowry be what it will be. <hi>Solomon</hi> himself, a most wise King in his Youth, plaid the fool in his old Age, broke the Bonds of Duty and Loyalty to his God, Equity to his Subjects, and Prudence to himself; this Passion did so far divest him of the Rule of his own Spirit. That Expression of the Heathen Philosopher, of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> accounted the Supreme Deity, runs highest in this Evidence, and with that I shall conclude it; <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter himself cannot love and be wise at once.</hi> This is
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:101491:118"/> a great Document, but Thanks be to God we have the Kowledg of a greater and a better Deity.</p>
                  <p>Revenge is as great an Usurper on the Authority of the superior Soul, an Usurpation of what is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to God and the Magistrate, and renders our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits as ungoverned by the Understanding as any other. It is one of the first Masters of Misrule that appears in the human corrupted Nature. Children before they can speak, can fight, and shew sad Tokens of what they would do, did not their Impotency rather than their <hi>Innocency</hi> restrain them. The World is in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Flame by the Heat of this unbridled Passion. If we are but displeased, our Minds crossed, right or wrong, the cause just or unjust, all is one; the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Revenge is as little consulted as the Cause. What mad work did <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> make upon the <hi>Shechemites,</hi> left not a Man of them alive, after they had made so brotherly a Covenant, and brought them to profess their own Religion, and all for one Man's inordinate Affection to their Sister. <hi>Cain</hi> would be revenged on <hi>Abel,</hi> for being a better Man than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and more accepted of God. <hi>Haman</hi> would revenge <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s Contempt, with the utter Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Yea, <hi>David</hi> would leave neither <hi>Nabal</hi> nor any of <hi>his</hi> alive that could piss against the Wall, because he had a cross Answer from a Churl by name and by Nature. All these Evidences (and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more that might be added) speak plainly the <hi>Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruliness</hi> of Mens Spirits, what a poor ineffectual thing the Understanding and Conscience is among Men. As it was before the Floud, the Earth is now filled with <hi>Violence,</hi> which Men <hi>begin,</hi> by first <hi>violating</hi> their own Understandings and Consciences, by neglecting and rejecting the Government of their own Spirits.</p>

                     <p>Five Motives to engage us to the Rule of our own Spirits.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>FIrst, <hi>He that can rule his own Spirit, has the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his own Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if there be no Motive in this to the greatest, and most difficult Undertaking, 'tis with the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving: For whose <hi>Conviction,</hi> I will first give down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and down-weight Authority, <hi>the Word of God: A good Man shall be satisfied from himself. Let</hi>

                     <hi>in himself, and not in another.</hi> This latter Text I have used in this Tract once, if not twice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but I dare say 'twill not be worn out with many times using. I bless God it has been my daily<note place="margin">Joh. 4. 14.</note> Bread, and I have found it no light Food. 'Tis a blessed thing not to have our Peace in another's Power. While others take Fire like Thatch, by the Sparks of his Neighbours House; this Man is like Matter that is not Combustible. Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to him but as the Waves that dash themselves in pieces against the Rock; leaving it where, and what it was without change. Whatever Affronts a Man meets with from Men, he keeps his Peace 'till he loses his <hi>Patience. In your Patience possess ye your Souls.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 21. 19</note> It is a pitiful Slavery to have our Peace, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence our All (for what is any thing to us without <hi>Peace</hi>) in the Power of <hi>others,</hi> of others that are not in their <hi>own Power.</hi> What an easy and a light thing is it for another, for every mean, foolish, insignificant Person to give us a bad Word, a wry Look, a neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:101491:119"/> scornful Behaviour, to wrong us in our Goods and good Name. If we have but the Rule of our own Spirits, a Power to guide them by Reason; how contemptible will all these Provocations be; how far from removing a weighty Soul, or working in it any Commotion or Disturbance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>He that rules not his Spirit, his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, loseth the Rule of his better Part;</hi> His Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is fruitless to its principal End. As good have no Ears or Eyes, as not hear and see with them. As good have no Understanding, and better too, than to have it and not use it. It is the Understanding in which we excel the Beasts of the Field, and the Fowls of the Air; in any other Faculty, what are we bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they. <hi>Man that is in Honour, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth not, is like the Beasts that perish.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea I will add all the Accomplishments a Man is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, (as the Ornaments or Powers of the Mind) are lost, where a Man rules not his own Spirit. What is Learning good for, without teaching our selves; yea what are the Principles and Habits of Grace or Vertue (we suppose and profess our selves qualified with) good for, without being exerted to Self-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: In very deed good for nothing but to add to our Account, and render them and the Profession of them a Contempt and Scorn to Men. But if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider strictly our Affections, as they are qualified and move within our selves, they are capable of great Disorder, and Obliquity or Sinfulness in relation to external Actions, that are materially good and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Our Understandings and Consciences have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Province to take care of, and Conduct than the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Face</hi> of our Conversation, which is exposed to the observation of Men. When this outside looks fair,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:101491:119"/> the inside may be full of Rottenness &amp; Deformity. Pride, Self-love, Vain-glory, worldly Interest, may run riot within. If our Spirits are not so govern'd as to have a conformity to the Rule, so far our superior Faculties are in vain and waste; can give no good Account to God of their Talent and Trust. Men judg the inside by the outside, but God judges the outside by the inside. <hi>I</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 17. 10.</note>
                     <hi>the Lord search the Heart, and try the Reins. Every Man must give an Account of himself to God.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That Man that rules his own Spirit, <hi>is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to all Duties which he understands to be such, to all Injoyments, to possess them and dispose them honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, holily, comfortably, for all Afflictions to bear them with Patience and Moderation, if not with Cheerfulness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Affections under the Conduct of our Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, habituated to its Rule, are not like unbroken Horses, full of Mettle, but for use and service utterly awkward and unfit, that must be brought to another pass before they will move readily in the Road and Path into which the Rider gently directs them. It is a pleasant and blessed thing for a Man to have his Spirit so tractable, that it will be led by the Conduct of the Understanding, and the Empire of a sanctified Will into its Duty, and from one Duty to another; as we can go out of one Room into another. Such regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Motions, without the Jadings and contradicting Frowardness of the Affections are exceeding beautiful and grateful to our selves, and also in the Eyes of God conform to the new Creature, which is said to be <hi>God's</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 10.</note>
                     <hi>Workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good Works,</hi> i. e. every way disposed to them. The imperfection of this Readiness was the Apostle's continual Grief; <hi>To will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good I know not.</hi> The inferior Soul did either rebel or hang backward.</p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:101491:120"/>
                  <p>And as to our Injoyments, according to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we have of our Spirits, they will be serviceable to God's Glory, comfortable to our selves, useful to others. Men by being over-fond of outward good Things in Possession, are rather smother'd than refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by them. We may overlay our Mercies, and they also may overlay us, by our <hi>overloving</hi> them. Our Care to keep, and Fear to lose them may turn them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pricking Briars and grieving Thorns; a Burden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a Blessing. Besides immoderate Affections will make us so fond of them, that they shall neither be at God's Command, nor our Brothers need.</p>
                  <p>Whereas, having the Rule of our own Spirits, these <hi>Servants</hi> shal not become our <hi>Masters</hi> nor our <hi>Miseries.</hi> We shall give them their <hi>Lodgings</hi> where they ought to be; not in our Hearts nor Heads neither, farther than for Direction, but in our <hi>Hands</hi> to dispose of; as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ought to administer their Masters Trust, for his Service, at his <hi>Pleasure,</hi> and their own <hi>natural</hi> Support.</p>
                  <p>This well-govern'd Spirit hath a sweet Influence also on us, in reference to Afflictions. As our Pleasures in Ease and Injoyments, so our Griefs under Crosses will be moderate. Inordinate Passions on either part may be deadly. The weaned Child can look on the Breasts it is <hi>denied,</hi> and in which it tasted before so much Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, with a <hi>contented Smile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>Every good Man and Woman doth sincerely aim at that Rule of its own Spirit proposed. The Law of God is in his Heart,</hi> he would be what God would have him be. It is a vain thing for any to conclude their Estate good, their Character good who do not take Christ's Yoak on them, who use not their Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to direct their Wills, and mortify the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies and Corruptions of their Affections.</p>

                  <p>Twelve Directions and means for the obtaining<note place="margin">Direct. 1.</note> the rule and government of our own Spirits.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>A weighty and impartial Consideration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Consideration</hi> is near of kin to <hi>reasoning,</hi> but 'tis confined within our selves. It is the <hi>exercise</hi> of knowledg and reason, those faculties wherein the excellency of man shines above the meer animals. It is this that weighs in the ballance, and brings to the touch-stone that we may discern the quality and quantity of things we are concerned to judg of, and their true tendencies. Without it we are uncapable of Law or Rule, and the due applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. And there is this eminent difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween rational and irrational Creatures, that the later being conducted by instinct, they move by pure inclination almost as naturally and as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily as the fire upwards, and heavy bodies down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: Whereas man as a rational and intelligent being is committed by the wise Creator to the conduct of his Reason duly improved, to elect or reject as it represents, which necessarily requires Consideration. According to this <hi>Seneca</hi> gives this excellent sentence, <hi>Tunc per rationem recte vives, si omnia prius existimes &amp; perpendes &amp; ex natura eorum</hi>

                  <p>It is impossible that a man should govern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that knows not himself in some competent measure. He that will order man or beast, must consider the variety of their dispositions, and use a discipline suitable to that variety; else he will act at the same rate of indiscretion and disappointment, as the Physitian who prescribes but one and the same remedy and method for all Patients and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases.

He that is a good Charioter or Coachman, will have the bit, and the rein, and the whip too, for every horse; but he will lash most at the most dull, and keep the streightest rein, and strictest eye on the most unruly.

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:101491:122"/> had need take heed that Satan never find us off our guard, or take us napping. Two things espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially we should continually watch.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>All occasions of sinning.</hi> We know, or may know what they are, and have been. <hi>Watch—that ye enter not into temptation.</hi> It is little sign that he who knows what have been the occasions of the disorders of his spirit, and yet shall either <hi>seek</hi> them, or not <hi>shun</hi> them, has any hearty purpose to order his spirit and conversation aright. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider seriously that accurate <hi>advice, Enter not into the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 4 14.</note>
                     <hi>path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men; avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Watch the emotions of any affection from its due order.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These the Apostle calls <hi>the motions of sin that work in our members.</hi> These motions are the sad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the best of men. These were principally the evils under the sense of which that holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle groaned; yet if they go no farther than those motions, 'tis no small degree of holiness and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, such a well governed spirit, as a <hi>better</hi> we are not like to attain, while it lodges in this earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tabernale.</p>
                  <p>But if we suffer the disorder of our passions to go on, 'tis as hard to curb them as the horse that has got the bit in his mouth, or to quench the flame, or cure the disease that has gotten head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Principiis obsta, sera est medicina parata.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men talk sometimes of plucking up the evils of sinful disorders by the roots, and at other times of a source of all sin in every person, and that 'tis like the Ivy in the wall that will never clearly out while the wall stands; reconcile these things who can.</p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:101491:123"/>
                  <p>Yet if a spirit of Wisdom and Grace dwell in thy soul, set them on work to check those motions at their first, and it will be a means not only to preserve thee from obeying them to the fulfilling their lusts; but also to render their motions less frequent and violent; and the Tempter more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from attempting what he finds crusht in the egg, and but a labour in vain.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Be not discouraged, tho thou findest not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Direct. 5.</note>
                     <hi>or any sensible success, at thy first attempts: No, tho thy affections are more sinfully violent and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Strong and powerful habits are not easily and suddenly vanquisht. Some great and amazng en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter may so astonish them, that they shall seem <hi>really dead,</hi> when yet the best shall find they have too much life in them, and will soon have a resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rcction, tho not to their former strength. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Conversion had as great a blow, and as signal a violence from Heaven against all disobedience to that Jesus, whom before he hated and persecuted, that one would think he should have had every irregular affection wholly mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but his confession and complaints inform us otherwise. Sometimes where a sense of sin and wrath is suddenly turned into the more powerful impressions of Divine love, and pardoning Grace; the joy in, and gratitude for such a Salvation works the grace of love into a flame, that no sin can stand before it, and all the affections crowd after this triumphing love, and budg not from a conformity to its strictest Laws. Yet after a while, when its fervor is a little spent, inordinate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will find work enough to do for all her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:101491:123"/> for every grace, with whatever assistance from without, or from above.</p>
                  <p>But let us consider the ordinary case of attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (and regularly too) the reducing our spirits to their duty, and bringing them under the Law of an enlightned and sanctified understanding; and we shall find that 'tis not to be done with a wet fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. The heart will be off and on; this holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose will make some advances, and it may be as many retreats; that it will be hard to find a foot of ground gain'd; the perversness and resistance of these wretched habits may tire our best spirits in every incounter, to no purpose (as we may be tempted to think) this is apt to be wofully dish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but especially if we shall find our lusts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affections grow upon us in their motions, as fire by cold or wind grows more vehement. Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not at this: for Satan knows how precious a soul is, and will very unwillingly part with such a rich prey. He is the strong one that keeps the house, and will not easily be outed. But 'tis sport and triumph to him to see the vain attempts of poor cowardly fresh-water soldiers, who make a flourish, and brave essays at distance from foe or trouble; but a small inconvenience sends them home with a base dishonourable peace, clapt up to their enemies greater advantage, and to their own loss and shame.</p>
                  <p>I do not advise thee to measure the time, or charge of this great and so necessary a work, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thy all of both: <hi>So work out your salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> and God will work <hi>in you to will and to do of his own good pleasure,</hi> to attempt and perform also. But however troublesome these
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:101491:124"/> habits of inordinate affection, loose affections may be which know not thee nor God for their master, yet when they have been once broken and tamed, how easie, how sweet will the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thy spirit be to thee? Habits of Grace will apparently prevail. The victory will recompence all the costs with infinite advantage. Thou wilt not dream as before, but feel thy self happy, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into that rest which is the earnest and Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of everlasting rest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let that ungoverned spirit you see in others, in all, or</hi>

We have so many sad representations of unruly licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious spirits, and voluntiers in all manner of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness, that we need not be at the cost and guilt of forcing some into that pit, we would preserve our selves or others from. We have among our selves a custom to put our garments on others backs (especially on theirs who are much of our own make) to understand thereby the better how they will <hi>become our own.</hi> If we were but as wise and faithful in our soul-concerns, their health and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as for our bodies, the world would soon be at a most sensible reformation. How ugly does wrath and passion, a morose, froward, uncultivated di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper look in another? and is not the same thing in our selves really as deformed? Who
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:101491:124"/> thinks that man or womans converse worth ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or rather n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If thou canst find any of these bad qualities in thine own spirit, hate them as much as thou dost the same in others; and so much the more as thou wouldest more fear to have the Plague or any noisome mortal disease, to fasten on thine own body, than on any others.</p>
                  <p>I must yet acknowledg that this direction will help thee but little in those disorders of spirit that consists in more spiritual evils; and as monstrous and deadly as any of the former, <hi>e. g.</hi> forgetfulness of God, enmity to the power of Godliness, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, inordinate love of the world, and the like.

Til then the Word of God must be thy Glass, which knows not how to flatter or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude, and thine own conscience, and the Spirit of God thy Monitors.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Maintain in thy soul a sense of the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Direct. 7. Psal. 16. 8.</note>
                     <hi>and all-seeing eye of God.</hi> Who but rank Ideots will play the fool, or give themselves the liberty to things unbecoming in the presence and eye of a Prince or Master, or any other for whom they have any reverence? Either men are for the greater part <hi>real</hi> Atheists, or they are such hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wretches as to think (or at least venture it) that they may make more bold with God than with the least of ten thousand among sinful mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:101491:125"/> men. Certainly the belief of a <hi>Deity</hi> is but a very superficial thing with <hi>most.</hi> But I hope I have now to deal with thee, who art perswaded to be a man, to behave thy self as such, and as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian also. And then I am sure thou wilt think my advice good, and knowest it to be so as far as thou hast tried it. Let a farther sense of this God enter thy soul, and it will not be easie for thee willingly or carelesly to give thy self (no not in thy inward man) a scope to any sin. Holy <hi>David</hi> practised this to very good purpose, <hi>I have set the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 16. 8.</note>
                     <hi>before me, because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.</hi> It was common among the <hi>Romans</hi> to check any extravagancy they were entring on, by saying, <hi>Cato sees you. Cato</hi> being a severe man, and by office the Censor of mens behaviour, and much reverenced by the people, they feared to come under his reproof, and suspected his eye was by one means or other every where.</p>
                  <p>Upon the consideration of the prevalency of the sense of Gods eye on us, those who live at loose, without this Law of restraint, are frequently in Scripture said to forget God, and to cast him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their backs. <hi>So are all the paths of all that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get</hi>

                     <hi>God.</hi> Let therefore this direction be well put in practice, and it will put the reins of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thine own spirit into thine hand. Thou wilt then as soon behave thy self as a malefactor in the eye of thy Judg, as before the eye of God. We may observe that sickness when it threatens death, or any eminent danger of death, gives men some sense of him with whom they have to do, quickens the thoughts of that account they are to give of themselves to God. What a change does
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:101491:125"/> this make? How are men in such a case cured of their licentious extravagancies? If this were abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on us at all times, as there is alway the same reason of it (for we alway are in God's eye, and take every step on the brink of Eternity) we should take heed to our selves at another rate than we do.</p>

The Spirit of God in its works: the new Birth: the Love and Law of God written in the heart. A man thus principled, is he who can, who doth walk after the Spirit, and not after the Flesh. He hath his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding enlightned by the Word and Spirit of God, and his passions or affections following the Divine Light; and not the earthly, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual, if not devillish Wisdom, as the Apostle ranks and styles them.</p>

I am almost confident that the issue of such Applications to the Throne of Grace, do seldom leave the Soul in a known sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful passion. Those intreaties of, and converses with God, tho they may and do often come short of our assurance of God's being reconciled to us, yet they never fail of reducing us to a disposition to a compleat dispositive reconciliation to the whole
